Walked in to make an appointment cause ZocDoc drives me crazy. I was really impressed with how clean it was. Tall guy was very helpful and everyone was friendly. Dr. Gonzales came out right on time and brought me back for annual physical. He was thorough, listened carefully to my list of concerns and had some great suggestions that didn\\'t involve expense perscriptions.They were very good with follow up too, letting me know results of blood work as soon as it came in.Great place! Check it out!\",GFfbbpxBB041X2RR9VYEew\\n3/11/2019,5.0,\"Dr. González and Angie are so awesome!!!!! Talking to Dr González is like talking to family, he listens never has he cut me off. Very empathetic crew; Leaf Medical did a god job choosing the LIC staff. Thank you guys for taking care of me.\",GFfbbpxBB041X2RR9VYEew\\n3/11/2019,5.0,\"I really love the patient-focused approach the LEAF system makes. We never wait for our appointment and always feel like our child\\'s time with the doctor is thorough and helpful. They\\'re also incredibly responsive to communication outside of the office, which has saved us not only time but a lot of late night worries when our young son broke out in hives and we were panicking what to do. I would highly recommend this practice to everyone. As we know, the modern medical system is full of unfortunate bureaucratic pratfalls, but Leaf Medical does a truly admirable job avoiding them for their patients.\",GFfbbpxBB041X2RR9VYEew\\n3/6/2019,5.0,\"I recently started seeing Dr. Gonzalez and I think he\\'s great. He\\'s very patient, doesn\\'t interrupt when I\\'m explaining things to him, and he not only hears me, but listens as well. I haven\\'t had that with many doctors in the past. It\\'s only been a short time, but Dr. Gonzalez and Leaf Medical has my full trust with regard to my health and medical care. I love the new Long Island City facility. It\\'s so crisp, clean, and professional, yet still warm and comfortable. The staff is excellent and I never wait beyond my scheduled appointment time. I\\'m very happy they came into the neighborhood.\",GFfbbpxBB041X2RR9VYEew\\n3/11/2019,5.0,\"Very friendly and competent staff (from the front desk, nurse and doctor). The facilities are very clean and new.They take time for you and are very patient oriented. Happy to have found this place in LIC\",GFfbbpxBB041X2RR9VYEew\\n3/12/2019,5.0,\"My experience at Leaf Medical was exceptional. Check-in was seamless and quick, I was seen at my appointment time, and Dr. Gonzalez took the time to explain in detail the results on my medical exams. The front desk staff was friendly as well. Leaf Medical is a great addition to the neighborhood were its been hard to find good primary care options for so long.\",GFfbbpxBB041X2RR9VYEew\\n3/11/2019,5.0,Happy I can see a doctor in LIC--- very convenient to get to and easy to make appointments. I came in on time and was seen shortly after with almost no wait. Front desk staff is welcoming and friendly. The space is brand new and has a fresh aesthetic which is a nice change from the drab decor I\\'m used to at most clinics. I got a thorough check up and got all my questions answered without feeling rushed.,GFfbbpxBB041X2RR9VYEew\\n3/6/2019,5.0,I went to see Dr. Gonzalez at Leaf Medical for my yearly check and was very happy with the whole process. The staff was very friendly and the space was comfortable and relaxing. Dr. Gonzalez gave me the space to ask him whatever questions I had and took his time to provide thorough explanations. I also liked his modern approach to medicine and his attention to details. Would definitely go back and recommend him and the clinic to everyone looking for compassionate and competent professionals!,GFfbbpxBB041X2RR9VYEew\\n11/22/2018,5.0,\"The best Doctor I have ever known, Dr. Raffinan takes his time with you and answers all concerns. His staff is amazing as well, I travel all the way from Jersey to see him, such a positive energy when I see him. Thanks so much for the professionalism and care you and your staff give......Rod Harrison\",_akjzY2DgJcy1UtXJh50KQ\\n1/25/2019,2.0,\"I want to start this review by prefacing that Dr. Raffinan is a great doctor. However it is clear the office managers here do not respect the patients like he does. I had an appointment for 8 AM on a Friday. Once I got into my car, I realized I was going to be 15-20 minutes late to my appointment due to unforeseen traffic. I immediately began calling the office at 8 AM when they opened to let them know I\\'d be late for my appointment. I called a total of 4 times, and nobody picked up. I even left a voice message, and got no return call. I finally get to the building 20 minutes later and receive a call saying I\\'m a \"\"no-show\"\" and have to wait until 11:30 AM. After explaining the situation to the woman and asking if they could take me at 8:30-9:30 because I could wait, she said no we can\\'t you were 20 minutes late and now you have to wait until 11:30. I have been a patient of Dr. Raffinan\\'s for 5 years now and my sister was his patient for many years before that. I was shocked that his employees were not even willing to work with me, and completely blamed me for not showing up even though I had made many attempts to inform them and try to fix the situation. Sadly, I will not be going back to this doctor and will look to find a better, kinder physicians office. If you want to keep your patients happy and provide the support they need, it should start with all employees and not just the physicians.\",_akjzY2DgJcy1UtXJh50KQ\\n5/19/2018,1.0,The doctor wasn\\'t able to diagnose me with Lyme. I went to see him at least 5 times with all sorts of symptoms and it NEVER occured to him to check for Lyme plus he is awkward as hell and makes you feel like your are an idiot when he speaks to you! They are mich better doctors out there especially functional ones! Don\\'t waist your time!,_akjzY2DgJcy1UtXJh50KQ\\n5/14/2015,5.0,\"I was extremely ill and did not have a local doctor I could call upon. I reached out to friends and could not get a timely recommendation. I searched Yelp and found Dr Raffinan. He was able to see me on the day I called for an appointment. I was quickly diagnosed and given some recommendations for treatment. As miserable as I was, I really appreciated the genuine care I received.I returned six months later for an annual physical exam. This is a very conscientious and empathic doctor.\",_akjzY2DgJcy1UtXJh50KQ\\n1/17/2015,5.0,\"I saw Dr. Raffinan a couple of weeks ago for my routine annual physical. This was my first time in a doctor\\'s office in two years and I sincerely wish I had known about Dr. Raffinan sooner.This was quite possibly the most pleasant, thorough, informative doctor\\'s appointment I\\'ve ever had in my entire life. I\\'m usually quite wary of most doctors because they\\'re usually unmotivated and very rote in bedside manner with unoriginal views, and lackluster personalities--Raffinan, the exact opposite. I was LITERALLY taken aback by how well I was treated. The entire time we spent together, he was engaged and offered great suggestions to improve my health and wellness. I felt so comfortable with him and open to express anything that randomly came to mind. Can\\'t wait to see him again next year.\",_akjzY2DgJcy1UtXJh50KQ\\n8/2/2016,5.0,Dr. Raffinan was phenomenal!!!!!! Almost no wait time and the professionalism from the staff was great. It was most impressive that Dr. Raffinan started our appointment by getting to know me personally and asking about my life!! Not many doctors take the time to build a relationship so thoroughly. I was most impressed- he asked me several times if I had questions about anything. I can totally tell he\\'s a great person and cares in many ways. Do yourself a favor and book with Dr. Raffianan. His practice takes almost all insurance too!,_akjzY2DgJcy1UtXJh50KQ\\n6/8/2017,1.0,\"I had the same experience as one of the reviewers below. The office charged me $25 for one of my annual exams. Today I had an appointment at his office, I asked the front desk to check and make sure that they are using the right code. I just had a bad experience with another doctor who randomly charged me close to $1K for 10min visit and asked me to pay the entire cost. Therefore I had to check with them to make sure they are coding or billing things correctly. The front desk people in this office are the worst I\\'ve ever seen. Nobody ever smiles or greets, they start at you in general when you come up to them and the tones are very rude and unprofessional. As usual, the women at front desk gave so much attitude and insisted that everything is insurance\\'s company\\'s fault. Well, later she asked me a few questions and pretended to type them but apparently not and I was asked again later on by the nurse practitioner. The nurse partitioner asked me to go ask myself why she didn\\'t write it down (she couldn\\'t done it for me since I was sitting at the patient bed already) and the answer was she couldn\\'t spell the words so she didn\\'t write them down. What kind of medical office is that? I saw the doctor 2-3 times and I think he is great but the rest of the office people makes me upset every time I go there. I need to find a new doctor since i can\\'t put up with the people there. The doctor really needs to find some good people to work from him in his office to keep his patients in check.\",_akjzY2DgJcy1UtXJh50KQ\\n7/8/2014,5.0,I\\'ve been with Dr Raffinan for several years now and this man is the best of the best.-Thorough-Kind and sympathetic-Explains everything and engages dialogue-Truly cares about quality of care received by patients-Thoughtful diagnosis and treatment-Considers all aspects of your lifestyle and asks many good questions to understand your unique situationIf you want a thorough and doctor genuinely interested in providing quality care go to Dr. Raffinan.,_akjzY2DgJcy1UtXJh50KQ\\n5/12/2016,1.0,\"WARNING TO PATIENTS: I decided to go to Dr. Raffinan for the first time to get an annual physical exam because he\\'s close to my office and is in-network through my insurance. My insurance covers physical exam at 100% ie I don\\'t have a copay. However, the office charged me a $30 copay after the visit. When I checked with my insurance on why this happened, I was told that the Dr submitted a claim for a physical exam as well as an office visit. I\\'ve had the same insurance for many years and have received annual physicals from different doctors and have never had this happen to me before. I asked my insurance if this was legal and they said that it unfortunately was but considered it \"\"highly unethical\"\" (insurance\\'s words, not mine) to do so. They further explained that the doctor was essentially \"\"douple dipping\"\" and charging the patient numerous times for the same visit. When I view the claim on my insurance\\'s website, I get the following note about the charge: \"\"You do not have to pay this. When more than one procedure is done on the same date, the main service is considered at 100% of the negotiated rate.\"\" This further proves that I shouldn\\'t have been charged for the office visit since my only reason for going was to get a physical. I\\'ve called the office 5 times now to try to get a refund and I have yet to go beyond the person at the front desk. Each time they assure me that someone from accounting will call me back to resolve this problem but this has yet to happen. In the grand scheme of things, $30 is not a lot of money but what really annoys and saddens me about Dr Raffinan and his staff is the fact that they coded my visit for numerous other things to get more money from his patient. So regardless of whether your insurance has a copay for annual physical exams, be prepared to pay extra for your visit.\",_akjzY2DgJcy1UtXJh50KQ\\n2/24/2016,5.0,\"Just went for my first appointment and had a great experience. You have to fill out a questionnaire before you go if you\\'re going for a physical, which I found extremely helpful. It seems like he really cares about your well being and will ask you questions about everything. The staff are pretty nice, can\\'t really complain about anything in regards to my visit.\",_akjzY2DgJcy1UtXJh50KQ\\n2/12/2014,5.0,\"I have been a patient of Dr. Raffinan\\'s for at least 5 years. He is the BEST! The only negative thing I can say is that he moved out of his Park Slope office. He\\'s very relaxed and spends a lot of time with his patients. His portal is great because you can request refills and schedule appointments in the off hours when most doctor\\'s offices are closed, yet it\\'s the only time we can get to these things. He personally answers your requests through the portal (weekends as well). Any time he has had to refer me, I\\'ve found that his referrals are also great doctors with the same comfortable personality. He really has a great network that he reaches out to.I can\\'t say enough good things about Dr. Raffinan and his practice. My husband goes to him as well and thinks he\\'s great.\",_akjzY2DgJcy1UtXJh50KQ\\n8/29/2015,5.0,\"Dr. Raffinan is a wonderful, knowledgable practitioner who perfectly balances holistic and evidence based model of practice. As a fellow physician, I cannot recommend him enough.\",_akjzY2DgJcy1UtXJh50KQ\\n6/25/2015,4.0,\"Based on my first and only visit, doctor was great. He was prompt, attentive and didn\\'t make me feel rushed. He took care to answer all my questions and address my concerns. Bedside manners are excellent and he instilled confidence that he knew what he was doing.The front office was less than smooth. The person I spoke with when I called to make the the appointment gave me the wrong time by 15 minutes and she couldn\\'t get down my email address correctly after I called her and made several attempts. Also, not sure what happened but they didn\\'t forward my insurance information to the lab so I ended up getting a bill and had to call them directly to clear up the confusion. Turned out that my information wasn\\'t forwarded properly, if at all. Not a big deal as it didn\\'t impact my schedule that much - but somewhat annoying to have to correct.If you don\\'t mind dealing with mediocre front office staff in exchange for a good family physician, I would recommend. Also I would recommend booking appointments online or through zocdoc rather than calling them.\",_akjzY2DgJcy1UtXJh50KQ\\n8/16/2016,5.0,\"I really like him as a primary care physician. It\\'s relatively easy to get an appointment. He doesn\\'t rush you out the door. He seems very caring. I also like a doctor who is open to the idea of avoiding medication and medical tests. And his office is well organized. I didn\\'t have to wait for a long time. I highly, highly recommend him.\",_akjzY2DgJcy1UtXJh50KQ\\n1/9/2013,5.0,\"Dr. Raffinan is a great doctor as many people have mentioned on this site (and unfortunately a bunch of good reviews are filtered).He\\'s very thorough and doesn\\'t rush through an appointment. I\\'m sad his Brooklyn offices are closing (I live in bk), but luckily his Manhattan location is very close to my workplace. I recently had a physical, he did full blood work and I got my booster shots. Plus, he told me tips on how to reach my goal in toning my body besides the running I\\'ve been doing. I also have asthma and he gave me an alternative medication in consideration of my long term health and showed me the discount website that I filled out in the office (only one other doctor has ever done that for me). What I really like is that he explains everything, which is important to me. He definitely does the PSA stuff, but hey, that\\'s what doctor\\'s do. Gotta remind you! I\\'d take any advice from him since he looks younger than he is and in great shape.His staff is also very kind. I get nauseous whenever I have my blood drawn and they accomodated. Of course, the webportal is awesome and he sent in my prescriptions while we were chatting. It\\'s true that getting an appointments might be up to a month to schedule, but they accommodate emergencies and often people cancel so you can get in earlier if you check in.\",_akjzY2DgJcy1UtXJh50KQ\\n12/20/2013,4.0,\"I\\'ve been going to Dr. Raffinan for several years as my primary care physician. I like that his practice keeps your records, allows you to book appointments, and communicate with the doctor online. In person he\\'s kind and takes the time to discuss everything you need to. I used to go to his Brooklyn practice which always meant a wait. For some reason, the Manhattan office is much less crowded, even though the Brooklyn office closed last year.\",_akjzY2DgJcy1UtXJh50KQ\\n6/29/2013,5.0,\"Wowww. The problem with going to Dr. Raffinan is that I now will have ridiculously high expectations for all other doctors. If I could give him ten stars, I would. I JUST started coming here. I put off finding a PCP forever, but then when I hurt my ankle running, I couldn\\'t put it off anymore. I stumbled across his reviews, and amazingly got an appointment for two days later due to a cancellation. (Though why anyone would cancel is beyond me.)This was different than any other doctor\\'s appointment I had ever had. I waited for no more than five minutes before the nurse took me into a room for my vitals. He came into the room seriously not even two minutes later. And he greeted me with, \"\"Well, I saw you hop up a few minutes ago-- which is good news! How\\'s the ankle?\"\" I HAD NEVER MET HIM BEFORE!! He had read up on my online questionnaire and knew everything already! It was amazing. And since I was a new patient, he spent a good deal of time getting to know me: what my lifestyle was like, what I ate, what I did for a living, and even down to what my favorite things to do at the gym were. The next day, he himself personally messaged me through the patient portal to tell me the results of my tests and to talk about my ankle. I really, really felt that this was top notch, all around treatment. He actually does care about each and every patient. I cannot believe that people like him exist-- let alone on Wall Street. As I was walking out, I felt as if I had just spent an hour in some fictional perfect little small town. Then I looked down the street and saw the Woolworth Building and was reminded differently. Everything is done through the patient portal-- which maximizes efficiency. You request appointments, ask questions, and fill out your medical history through the portal before coming in. Then, when you get in, everyone is on the same page. Amazing. I cannot recommend him highly enough. All other doctors should aspire to be like him.\",_akjzY2DgJcy1UtXJh50KQ\\n7/18/2014,5.0,Dr Raffinan is just plain WONDERFUL. He has been my doctor for several years and I feel extraordinarily lucky. He also has managed to hire some great people to manage his office. If you can join his practice DO - NOW.

He is very attentive to your lifestyle and gives you thorough health advices. I\\'d also like to highlight the following:- Dr. Raffinan provides \"\"same day appointment\"\" for emergency patients. You can call in at 8 AM and almost can be guaranteed a spot for that day.- Dr. Raffinan makes sure you sign up for eclinical patient portal where you can see all your exam results and easily communicate with the doctor (i.e. request refills, ask health-related questions, etc.)- His new office on 111 Broadway is really cool, decorated with mid-century furniture and Brooklyn-inspired art pieces. They did a good job in the new office.\",_akjzY2DgJcy1UtXJh50KQ\\n7/16/2013,5.0,Great doctor. He really takes his time with his patients.

I\\'m usually quite wary of most doctors because they\\'re usually unmotivated and very rote in bedside manner with unoriginal views, and lackluster personalities--Raffinan, the exact opposite. I was LITERALLY taken aback by how well I was treated. The entire time we spent together, he was engaged and offered great suggestions to improve my health and wellness.

Can\\'t wait to see him again next year.\",_akjzY2DgJcy1UtXJh50KQ\\n8/2/2016,5.0,Dr. Raffinan was phenomenal!!!!!! Almost no wait time and the professionalism from the staff was great. It was most impressive that Dr. Raffinan started our appointment by getting to know me personally and asking about my life!! Not many doctors take the time to build a relationship so thoroughly. I was most impressed- he asked me several times if I had questions about anything. I can totally tell he\\'s a great person and cares in many ways. Do yourself a favor and book with Dr. Raffianan. His practice takes almost all insurance too!,_akjzY2DgJcy1UtXJh50KQ\\n6/8/2017,1.0,\"I had the same experience as one of the reviewers below. The office charged me $25 for one of my annual exams. Today I had an appointment at his office, I asked the front desk to check and make sure that they are using the right code. I just had a bad experience with another doctor who randomly charged me close to $1K for 10min visit and asked me to pay the entire cost. Therefore I had to check with them to make sure they are coding or billing things correctly. The front desk people in this office are the worst I\\'ve ever seen. Nobody ever smiles or greets, they start at you in general when you come up to them and the tones are very rude and unprofessional. As usual, the women at front desk gave so much attitude and insisted that everything is insurance\\'s company\\'s fault. Well, later she asked me a few questions and pretended to type them but apparently not and I was asked again later on by the nurse practitioner. The nurse partitioner asked me to go ask myself why she didn\\'t write it down (she couldn\\'t done it for me since I was sitting at the patient bed already) and the answer was she couldn\\'t spell the words so she didn\\'t write them down. What kind of medical office is that? I saw the doctor 2-3 times and I think he is great but the rest of the office people makes me upset every time I go there. I need to find a new doctor since i can\\'t put up with the people there.

My insurance covers physical exam at 100% ie I don\\'t have a copay. However, the office charged me a $30 copay after the visit. When I checked with my insurance on why this happened, I was told that the Dr submitted a claim for a physical exam as well as an office visit. I\\'ve had the same insurance for many years and have received annual physicals from different doctors and have never had this happen to me before. I asked my insurance if this was legal and they said that it unfortunately was but considered it \"\"highly unethical\"\" (insurance\\'s words, not mine) to do so. They further explained that the doctor was essentially \"\"douple dipping\"\" and charging the patient numerous times for the same visit. When I view the claim on my insurance\\'s website, I get the following note about the charge: \"\"You do not have to pay this. When more than one procedure is done on the same date, the main service is considered at 100% of the negotiated rate.\"\" This further proves that I shouldn\\'t have been charged for the office visit since my only reason for going was to get a physical. I\\'ve called the office 5 times now to try to get a refund and I have yet to go beyond the person at the front desk. Each time they assure me that someone from accounting will call me back to resolve this problem but this has yet to happen. In the grand scheme of things, $30 is not a lot of money but what really annoys and saddens me about Dr Raffinan and his staff is the fact that they coded my visit for numerous other things to get more money from his patient. So regardless of whether your insurance has a copay for annual physical exams, be prepared to pay extra for your visit.\",_akjzY2DgJcy1UtXJh50KQ\\n2/24/2016,5.0,\"Just went for my first appointment and had a great experience. You have to fill out a questionnaire before you go if you\\'re going for a physical, which I found extremely helpful.

He is the BEST! The only negative thing I can say is that he moved out of his Park Slope office. He\\'s very relaxed and spends a lot of time with his patients. His portal is great because you can request refills and schedule appointments in the off hours when most doctor\\'s offices are closed, yet it\\'s the only time we can get to these things. He personally answers your requests through the portal (weekends as well). Any time he has had to refer me, I\\'ve found that his referrals are also great doctors with the same comfortable personality.

He was prompt, attentive and didn\\'t make me feel rushed. He took care to answer all my questions and address my concerns. Bedside manners are excellent and he instilled confidence that he knew what he was doing.The front office was less than smooth. The person I spoke with when I called to make the the appointment gave me the wrong time by 15 minutes and she couldn\\'t get down my email address correctly after I called her and made several attempts. Also, not sure what happened but they didn\\'t forward my insurance information to the lab so I ended up getting a bill and had to call them directly to clear up the confusion. Turned out that my information wasn\\'t forwarded properly, if at all. Not a big deal as it didn\\'t impact my schedule that much - but somewhat annoying to have to correct.If you don\\'t mind dealing with mediocre front office staff in exchange for a good family physician, I would recommend. Also I would recommend booking appointments online or through zocdoc rather than calling them.\",_akjzY2DgJcy1UtXJh50KQ\\n8/16/2016,5.0,\"I really like him as a primary care physician. It\\'s relatively easy to get an appointment. He doesn\\'t rush you out the door. He seems very caring. I also like a doctor who is open to the idea of avoiding medication and medical tests.

I highly, highly recommend him.\",_akjzY2DgJcy1UtXJh50KQ\\n1/9/2013,5.0,\"Dr. Raffinan is a great doctor as many people have mentioned on this site (and unfortunately a bunch of good reviews are filtered).He\\'s very thorough and doesn\\'t rush through an appointment. I\\'m sad his Brooklyn offices are closing (I live in bk), but luckily his Manhattan location is very close to my workplace. I recently had a physical, he did full blood work and I got my booster shots. Plus, he told me tips on how to reach my goal in toning my body besides the running I\\'ve been doing. I also have asthma and he gave me an alternative medication in consideration of my long term health and showed me the discount website that I filled out in the office (only one other doctor has ever done that for me). What I really like is that he explains everything, which is important to me. He definitely does the PSA stuff, but hey, that\\'s what doctor\\'s do. Gotta remind you! I\\'d take any advice from him since he looks younger than he is and in great shape.His staff is also very kind. I get nauseous whenever I have my blood drawn and they accomodated. Of course, the webportal is awesome and he sent in my prescriptions while we were chatting. It\\'s true that getting an appointments might be up to a month to schedule, but they accommodate emergencies and often people cancel so you can get in earlier if you check in.\",_akjzY2DgJcy1UtXJh50KQ\\n12/20/2013,4.0,\"I\\'ve been going to Dr. Raffinan for several years as my primary care physician. I like that his practice keeps your records, allows you to book appointments, and communicate with the doctor online. In person he\\'s kind and takes the time to discuss everything you need to. I used to go to his Brooklyn practice which always meant a wait. For some reason, the Manhattan office is much less crowded, even though the Brooklyn office closed last year.\",_akjzY2DgJcy1UtXJh50KQ\\n6/29/2013,5.0,\"Wowww. The problem with going to Dr. Raffinan is that I now will have ridiculously high expectations for all other doctors. If I could give him ten stars, I would. I JUST started coming here. I put off finding a PCP forever, but then when I hurt my ankle running, I couldn\\'t put it off anymore. I stumbled across his reviews, and amazingly got an appointment for two days later due to a cancellation. (Though why anyone would cancel is beyond me.)This was different than any other doctor\\'s appointment I had ever had. I waited for no more than five minutes before the nurse took me into a room for my vitals. He came into the room seriously not even two minutes later. And he greeted me with, \"\"Well, I saw you hop up a few minutes ago-- which is good news! How\\'s the ankle?\"\" I HAD NEVER MET HIM BEFORE!! He had read up on my online questionnaire and knew everything already! It was amazing. And since I was a new patient, he spent a good deal of time getting to know me: what my lifestyle was like, what I ate, what I did for a living, and even down to what my favorite things to do at the gym were. The next day, he himself personally messaged me through the patient portal to tell me the results of my tests and to talk about my ankle. I really, really felt that this was top notch, all around treatment. He actually does care about each and every patient. I cannot believe that people like him exist-- let alone on Wall Street. As I was walking out, I felt as if I had just spent an hour in some fictional perfect little small town. Then I looked down the street and saw the Woolworth Building and was reminded differently. Everything is done through the patient portal-- which maximizes efficiency. You request appointments, ask questions, and fill out your medical history through the portal before coming in. Then, when you get in, everyone is on the same page. Amazing. I cannot recommend him highly enough. All other doctors should aspire to be like him.\",_akjzY2DgJcy1UtXJh50KQ\\n7/18/2014,5.0,Dr Raffinan is just plain WONDERFUL. He has been my doctor for several years and I feel extraordinarily lucky.

He is very attentive to your lifestyle and gives you thorough health advices. I\\'d also like to highlight the following:- Dr. Raffinan provides \"\"same day appointment\"\" for emergency patients. You can call in at 8 AM and almost can be guaranteed a spot for that day.- Dr. Raffinan makes sure you sign up for eclinical patient portal where you can see all your exam results and easily communicate with the doctor (i.e. request refills, ask health-related questions, etc.)- His new office on 111 Broadway is really cool, decorated with mid-century furniture and Brooklyn-inspired art pieces.

But, let\\'s be serious, if you are reading reviews of doctors you have probably seen a lot of nice things said about a lot of other doctors, so you are thinking \"\"the best? sure, but is the best really so much better that it is worth paying an annual fee for One Medical Group?\"\" and you are feeling hesitant to commit.Or not, whatever, congrats on your decisiveness, but that is definitely what I was thinking after bouncing from doctor to doctor for the past few years. I was worried that I might make the commitment and then regret it. I didn\\'t understand how Dr. Cho could be that much better than other doctors.Oh my god that was stupid. Dr. Cho is SO much better than other doctors. She thinks, she asks great questions, she listens, she explains, she cares! Try to imagine a doctor who does all of that really well. Like, imagine just a really stand out ideal doctor, the doctor that you really hope you will meet if you go for One Medical group. Are you imagining? Good. That doctor you are imagining sucks compared to Dr. Cho.The difference is that Dr. Cho doesn\\'t just care about her patients. She cares about her job. Deeply and to the point that it is obvious within minutes of meeting her (or I don\\'t know, can someone fake that? I don\\'t think so). So as a great doctor, with a team of great doctors around her, she probably has spent a lot of time, her life really, thinking about how to be the best doctor. Way more than you or I have spent. So she knows far more than we do about what a great doctor should do. That means that when you go to the office and see Dr. Cho there are so many things being done to make your visit go perfectly that you won\\'t even notice or understand them all. You just have a great experience.Then, what, I guess you sit down and think about it and try to explain it on Yelp and realize that you are under-qualified to explain why the experience was so great but you really want other people to know.So... yeah, all of that.

She makes sure that you understand everything that she found during your exam.She really does put her patients first and foremost, and you can see she loves the profession that she chose. Her staff is always helpful and very friendly. They try to have you not wait in the waiting room forever, they try to keep the appointments on schedule so that you are in and out. I have been here 3 times, and each time has been a nice experience. That is something new to be able to say about a doctor visit.

I also appreciate that when she has given me referrals, she recommends doctors the she has worked with and knows they will also provide a high level of care.I highly recommend Dr. Cho as well as One Medical. The office staff is professional, efficient and friendly. The office is probably the most comfortable doctors office I have encountered -modern decor with comfortable seating.

Whenever I came in for an appointment there was always refreshments in the artfully decorated waiting room, though I never had time to enjoy it since Dr. Cho was always ready for me. She has a beautiful office overlooking the NY Public Library on 5th Avenue and she started off the appointment at her desk going over my chart. She was patient, warm, and very professional. She went to Pitt Med - one of the best medical schools, so I know she knows her stuff! She made me feel comfortable in my first womens exam, and explained every step, which I appreciated. Every appointment with Dr. Cho has been top notch, and I wish her the very best.The One Medical staff is awesome too. There have been a couple times when I\\'ve had infections and they\\'ve been able to put me in touch with a nurse practioner who phoned in prescriptions to my nearest pharmacy right away, wherever I was. I could not appreciate this service more. They also do bloodwork right in the office - the guy who does it is pretty cool. I also loved how the office has embraced email - Dr. Cho and other doctors would always send me an email with my lab results, prescription confirmations, and reminders for specific follow-ups.  It\\'s the perfect level of \"\"concierge\"\" medicine for busy working professionals, and I only wish they\\'d open up an office in SoCal!\",sUwC1VYi2XJIXIFACiO7bQ\\n7/15/2010,5.0,\"My gynecologist and sometimes my general doctor.

Dr. Cho was very professional, did a thorough check of my medical history, and I felt totally comfortable during my physical. She has been extremely responsive to emails and is very informative about test results etc. The One Medical concept is really interesting, you pay a low flat fee for the visit and a membership fee which gives you all hours access to the docs, enables them to do same-day appointments, and other services.

Always a pleasant experience.\",yvlNsAIoWVRR2e9J46Y92g\\n12/29/2018,1.0,I never leave bad reviews but I feel this one was needed. I left my last visit in shock. I had emailed the office and called 3 times the next day when I was not getting a reply back about my blood work. It was very urgent because I\\'m having a surgery and the surgery center needs it. My last phone call was right before they were closing and I let the secretary know I was disappointed that I hadn\\'t heard back. That was literally all I said. I ended up hearing from the office and got a response not about my bloodwork but to let me know it wasn\\'t ok for me to express that I was disappointed? After I was told they could not even find my email where I attached what the surgery center needed finally they gave me the response of letting me know I needed more blood work. I went to the office the next day and was greeted by Dr. Liakeas in a way I had never seen before. He let me know he had a major issue that I used the word disappointed and implied that I was very angry over the phone which is the farthest thing from the truth. Whoever gave him that message exaggerated a whole lot. I literally just said I was disappointed as in I was sad to not hear back because it was urgent. In my opinion that wasn\\'t a big deal to say but wow was I wrong!!! The doctor basically let me know that this was no longer the office for me. He also let me know he wanted to put me in my place for using that word. And kept persisting to put words in my mouth about what I meant when I said the word disappointed. He kept telling me I was very angry over the phone. It\\'s pretty crazy because it\\'s so far from the truth. Also when I denied all of that and let him know that I explained to the secretary that it was urgent he let me know that she never relayed that part of the message. So she exaggerated how our conversation went on the phone but all day that I waited she couldn\\'t mention that it was urgent? At the end the doctor kind of giggled and said I\\'ll go yell at whoever relayed the message incorrectly. I have to say I did feel as though I was being yelled at the whole visit. He was speaking very disrespectfully to me and I\\'m still in disbelief. I would no longer recommend this doctor to anyone. No doctor should try to put a patient in their place. I am not his employee or his daughter and I don\\'t know who he thinks he is to talk to me the way he did. A real doctor would not act this way. I have to say this was the most unprofessional encounter I have ever had with any doctor I have ever been to. The best part is he did more blood work for me that day and I asked him if he had the fax number and if he will send it over. He said yes I\\'ll send that over. After expressing how important it was to send it over right away guess what? A whole week goes by and he still hasn\\'t faxed it over. I had to call the office to find out they needed a release form then it was finally sent over. He didn\\'t think to mention that in person?

Always a pleasant experience.\",yvlNsAIoWVRR2e9J46Y92g\\n12/29/2018,1.0,I never leave bad reviews but I feel this one was needed. I left my last visit in shock. I had emailed the office and called 3 times the next day when I was not getting a reply back about my blood work. It was very urgent because I\\'m having a surgery and the surgery center needs it. My last phone call was right before they were closing and I let the secretary know I was disappointed that I hadn\\'t heard back. That was literally all I said. I ended up hearing from the office and got a response not about my bloodwork but to let me know it wasn\\'t ok for me to express that I was disappointed? After I was told they could not even find my email where I attached what the surgery center needed finally they gave me the response of letting me know I needed more blood work. I went to the office the next day and was greeted by Dr. Liakeas in a way I had never seen before. He let me know he had a major issue that I used the word disappointed and implied that I was very angry over the phone which is the farthest thing from the truth. Whoever gave him that message exaggerated a whole lot. I literally just said I was disappointed as in I was sad to not hear back because it was urgent. In my opinion that wasn\\'t a big deal to say but wow was I wrong!!! The doctor basically let me know that this was no longer the office for me. He also let me know he wanted to put me in my place for using that word. And kept persisting to put words in my mouth about what I meant when I said the word disappointed. He kept telling me I was very angry over the phone. It\\'s pretty crazy because it\\'s so far from the truth. Also when I denied all of that and let him know that I explained to the secretary that it was urgent he let me know that she never relayed that part of the message. So she exaggerated how our conversation went on the phone but all day that I waited she couldn\\'t mention that it was urgent? At the end the doctor kind of giggled and said I\\'ll go yell at whoever relayed the message incorrectly. I have to say I did feel as though I was being yelled at the whole visit. He was speaking very disrespectfully to me and I\\'m still in disbelief. I would no longer recommend this doctor to anyone. No doctor should try to put a patient in their place. I am not his employee or his daughter and I don\\'t know who he thinks he is to talk to me the way he did. A real doctor would not act this way. I have to say this was the most unprofessional encounter I have ever had with any doctor I have ever been to. The best part is he did more blood work for me that day and I asked him if he had the fax number and if he will send it over. He said yes I\\'ll send that over. After expressing how important it was to send it over right away guess what? A whole week goes by and he still hasn\\'t faxed it over. I had to call the office to find out they needed a release form then it was finally sent over. He didn\\'t think to mention that in person? I would recommend going elsewhere!FYI no other doctor needs me to pay a \\'concierge membership fee\\' for better client service,yvlNsAIoWVRR2e9J46Y92g\\n11/5/2018,5.0,Great office and great staff!

I would highly recommend you book with her.Long story: When I arrived for my appointment today, Dr. Grishina\\'s assistant had already printed out the paperwork I submitted electronically through ZocDoc. All that I had to do was sign and date and I was done. Minutes later, Dr. Grishina walked out, introduced herself to me, and invited me into her office where we looked over my medical history together. I loved how, rather than going through a series of pre-written questions, we had a conversation about my history, habits, and health. Her questions felt tailored to me and that made me feel valued. During that conversation, Dr. Grishina was incredibly kind and patient and actively listened while I explained my needs. In the past, I have often felt rushed in medical settings, but I felt relaxed and comfortable with Dr. Grishina because of her polite and professional personality and also because of the look and feel of her office space. As funny as this may sound, Dr. Grishina\\'s office feels more like a home than a white box and that really helped to make the visit feel less procedural. When blood work was required, I confessed to Dr. Grishina that I was afraid of needles, and she immediately called her assistant in who held my hand and asked me if I\\'d like to tell her about my family. I can\\'t adequately describe that experience with words, but it was funny and sweet and I barely noticed the pain of the needle as my blood was drawn. I know that my fears might come across as silly or dramatic to some, but they were genuine and it meant a lot to me that I felt no judgement, only support and empathy from Dr. Grishina and her staff. I cannot recommend Dr. Grishina highly enough.

Dr. Is one of a kind - a real mensch, someone you could genuinely trust your life with, because he cares about your life as much as his own. Anytime I thought about straying simply for lack of convenience to where I now live, I quickly realize that it\\'s much cheaper and easier for me to take a long cab ride to Dr.\\'s Kap\\'s office then waste my time with any other doctor that is subpar or just doesn\\'t care as much as he always will. Dr. Kap, you\\'re crazy, quirky, nutty, but a true and total genius. I\\'m grateful to have be led to Dr. Kap. Oh, and I can\\'t forget his staff. Crystal is a genuine gem of a human. They are all top notch as far as office staff goes. I couldn\\'t recommend this practice more! Go!\",J1JVs7sQV3-5AJI3rLWaVQ\\n3/12/2019,1.0,\"The reviews for Dr. Kaplowitz sounded great, and I was all ready to make an appointment -- but he doesn\\'t accept insurance, only out of network, and no Medicare if you\\'re over 65. Of course, none of the reviews and sites out there tell you that. Guess I\\'ll keep looking for other internists.\",J1JVs7sQV3-5AJI3rLWaVQ\\n3/1/2018,5.0,If you are looking for an excellent doctor go no further. I choose Doctor Kap based off yelp reviews and after two years of living in New York I feel that I met a genuine quality doctor that I would like to stay with. His staff is personable and welcoming and he takes a genuine interest in patients. I\\'ve been to doctors offices before in manhattan where I felt like a number but Doctor Kap takes his time with patients and shows a genuine interest. I\\'m never a big fan of doctors visits but I have to say Doctor Kap makes the experience so much better and I don\\'t mind going to my next visit.,J1JVs7sQV3-5AJI3rLWaVQ\\n9/13/2016,5.0,My boyfriend and I LOVE Dr. Kap! He is incredibly thorough and incredibly kind. I had an illness that required surgery last fall-- Dr. Kap was able to find me a surgeon and helped make the surgery happen really quickly. I owe a lot to Dr. Kap! We recommend him to all of our friends.,J1JVs7sQV3-5AJI3rLWaVQ\\n5/5/2017,5.0,\"Not much to add to the other positive reviews. I can\\'t say enough good things about Dr. Kap. He is kind, thorough, accessible and knows his stuff. Yes, he orders a lot of tests, but I like that he leaves no stone unturned. Yes it will take up a lot of your time, but he approaches your care as a partner in it, so he also puts the time in. Oh, and if you need a referral to a specialist, you will be referred to someone with the same commitment to kind and thorough care that he has. Most importantly, he listens. His staff seems to love him. I used to work in healthcare, and I can tell you that is a great sign.\",J1JVs7sQV3-5AJI3rLWaVQ\\n5/4/2016,5.0,I went to the office last summer because I thought there were issues with my thyroid.

A senior-level medical professional at CUMC actually recommended him, and being 5 blocks away is great. While it is true I had the most bloodwork ever done, and it was costly, it was helpful. I am a new patient anyway, and sometimes internists like to really know their patients. He is very informal, fits you in if needed, and never speaks down to you. My husband will be seeing him as well. Overall, one of the better doctors I have seen over my life thus far, and I have seen a few dozens...\",J1JVs7sQV3-5AJI3rLWaVQ\\n11/19/2012,5.0,\"I switched to Dr. Kaplowitz at the recommendation of a trusted friend, as she knew that I was unhappy with my current PC for a number of reasons. It was the best medical decision I could have made. Dr. Kaplowitz stands out amongst the multitude of PCs who are out there because he is knowledgeable, truly patient-focused and has a warm and engaging personality that always makes you feel comfortable. Instead of rushing you in and out, Dr. Kaplowitz really listens to what you\\'re saying about whatever ailment you\\'re in for. Not only that, he considers different yet appropriate treatment options, based on your lifestyle and needs, and also takes relevant holistic treatments into account, instead of simply whipping out a prescription pad. For instance, I went to see him last time for an earache and he took the time to talk through my health history and explored a number of possibilities. It turned out that the pain was from grinding my teeth at night. I feel like most PCs would simply wave it off as an infection and send me on my way.Last but not least, I\\'ve never waited for more than five minutes in the waiting room to see him. What else could you ask for in a doc?\",J1JVs7sQV3-5AJI3rLWaVQ\\n11/18/2014,5.0,Today was my first time in this office. I had a great experience. The staff was extremely courteous and friendly.

I have now been a patient of Dr. Kaplowitz for 3 years and it has been nothing but a pleasant experience. He is absolutely an excellent Doctor. He is always very professional and very thorough. A+++++,J1JVs7sQV3-5AJI3rLWaVQ\\n4/1/2011,5.0,\"I cannot tell you how much I love Dr. Kaplowitz. I\\'ve had a lot of bad luck with general physicians, and have switched a lot ever since moving to New York because I was never happy with the quality of service I was receiving from my doctors. Then, I stumbled across Dr. Kap, and I\\'ve been very happy ever since!Dr. Kap takes the time to really make you feel like he listens to you. I\\'m an inquisitive person and I like to ask questions and really understand the different areas of my health. Dr. Kap is VERY knowledgeable and excellent with his medical skills, and he has always spent extra time explaining everything to me. He remembers specifics about my health from visits an entire year prior, and he\\'s so friendly and personable that I really feel valued as a patient. Also, he is very cost concientious and really watches out for the best interest of his patients. Another thing - I can actually call up Dr. Kap to ask questions and he\\'ll ANSWER! What a concept, right? A doctor that is actually responsive. Not his office assistants, not his nurse, but him. I called him up to ask about a procedure that I was considering, and he spent time talking to me about the pros and cons of it, and it was really nice to hear him tell me his medical opinion. On top of that, I really like the scheduling process with his office staff. They are friendly and I\\'m able to get appointments with the doctor within a couple of weeks -- not months away like with some other doctors. Additionally, Dr. Kap makes it a point to not make his patients wait for too long. I think the most I\\'ve ever waited is about 10 minutes! This is so helpful, because I often make appointments during lunchtime, so I hate when I have to wait for ages and then end up taking a lot of time away from work.Anyway, I am very happy that in the midst of this busy city, with a lot of doctors that just go through the motions and shuttle people in and out, there are doctors like Dr. Kap who appreciate their patients and offer an excellent medical experience.\",J1JVs7sQV3-5AJI3rLWaVQ\\n10/2/2015,5.0,\"Dr. Kaplowitz is amazing! He is what all Doctors should be: experienced, smart, knowledgable, human. He is there for you at any time you need him via email (be careful with HIPPA though- you can\\'t talk personal health stuff via email, so best call). It is important to build a good relationship with your PCP and follow up throughout the years. My husband and I both go to him and we miss him if we don\\'t see him for 6 months. He is not our friend, he is just our Primary Care Physician. But THAT\\'s how good he is: he makes you want to go see him as often as possible! :-)\",J1JVs7sQV3-5AJI3rLWaVQ\\n7/15/2014,1.0,After seeing David Kaplowitz on more than one occasion I would strongly urge anyone I know to never see him. It was terrible experience through and through. He tries to squeeze as much money as he can out of you and your insurance by performing tests that are 100% not necessary upon your visit. Although it\\'s fun to watch him argue the reason as to why you need them. His examining rooms are cluttered and completely disorganized. He also will ask that you see him once every four to six weeks. Why? Because of no other reason then for him to take advantage of you financially. I have seen numerous internists over the course of my life and have never been told by any that I had to see them on a consistent basis (while not sick in any way). When I had seen him upon a third and final visit he got incredibly angry with me because I had not scheduled a visit to see him weeks earlier. Of course there was nothing wrong with me weeks earlier. Kaplowitz\\'s demeanor and personality resembles more that of a used car salesman than a professional doctor. There are plenty of great internists in NYC. This is not one of them.,J1JVs7sQV3-5AJI3rLWaVQ\\n1/1/2014,5.0,\"Dr. Kaplowitz is one of the best doctors i met.He is polite, very knowledgeable and thorough.Dr. K took care of my son before his surgery and I can\\'t thank him enough for the fantastic job he did.\",J1JVs7sQV3-5AJI3rLWaVQ\\n2/11/2012,5.0,\"I first saw Dr. Kap a little over a year ago. I had been feeling lousy and had no energy. I was overweight, never exercised, and smoked half a pack of cigarettes a day. I went to Dr. Kap first because he accepted my insurance and he had a great looking website. I really lucked out because ultimately Dr. Kap saved my life. During the first visit all my blood tests came back normal. Dr. Kap told me to stop smoking, lose weight, and eat better and gave me some good tips and encouragement on doing so. After 8 months of no smoking, cutting out all the bad food and eating healthy, along with exercise I still felt lousy every day and had no energy. In fact my symptoms had gotten even worse. Every day I felt exhausted. I was getting anxiety attacks and frequent heart palpitations that would last for hours. It made my entire life miserable. I went back to Dr. Kap and told him how bad I was feeling. Unlike most doctor\\'s I have seen in the past he did not try to diagnose me right from the start or try to play down my symptoms. He did many different blood tests, EKGs, x-rays, and even a sonogram of my heart. All this was done right in his medical group which was great because it saved me many different trips to other specialists. All my tests came back pretty much normal. As we were talking about my case one visit I mentioned that I snore a lot and Dr. Kap figured out that I probably had sleep apnea and that could be causing my exhaustion, anxiety, and heart palpitations. What makes Dr. Kap such a great doctor is that unlike many others I have seen in the past he will actually sit and talk with you like a normal person. He does not rush in and rush out but takes his time and develops a genuine relationship with his patients. If it wasn\\'t for this friendly conversation I probably never would have mentioned my snoring. Dr. Kap got my set up with a sleep study and I was diagnosed with sleep apnea. He set me up with a medical device called a CPAP and once I got that I began to feel better overnight. It has been 4 weeks since I got my CPAP and all my past symptoms are almost gone. I haven\\'t had a heart palpitation or anxiety attack in 2 weeks. Best yet Dr. Kap set me up with a nutritionist at his medical group and I have already begun to lose weight. My symptoms were so bad that many days I felt like dying. Dr. Kap took the time to hear me out, test for all possible causes, treat my condition, and help me begin to improve my overall health. I can always reach him on the phone anytime. How many doctors can you say that about? I highly recommend Dr. Kaplowitz.\",J1JVs7sQV3-5AJI3rLWaVQ\\n9/29/2014,5.0,\"I live in California for over 2 years now and I haven\\'t find a doctor like this here yet.

To Cathy\\'s credit she did call my phone 3 days prior to appointment but who listens to vms? Not sure why the website let me make an appointment, the text message system confirmed it, before Dr. Sunwoo\\'s office decided her time is more valuable than mine.

My coworker/friend recommended that I go to her since I was looking for a new general practitioner in 2016 and I\\'ve been coming here ever since. This is a concierge medical office - appointments are made on ZocDoc (or you can call the office), the office has modern decor and iPads, and patients can review their blood test results and all doctor\\'s comments on the patient portal. I travel all the way from Dyker Heights to see Dr. Sunwoo for my appointments which is a hike (about $17 Uber ride each way) but I definitely save time by going here because I\\'m always taken at my appointment time.Another reason why I switched general practitioners is because my previous doctor could never see me when I was actually sick.

I think she saw that I was carrying a baby and stroller and all his stuff, and she sprung up to help. That was a first! Once we got inside, the waiting areas were really nice and there was no shortage of things to keep little Dylan occupied. This place is really really clean which is important to me when I have a 1 year old that touches literally everything. It\\'s like why do I want to bring my baby to the doctor just so he can get even sicker when he gets home. You can tell right away that they take amazing care of the facility at Leaf. Also who designed this place. It\\'s out of the world. I was joking with a friend that I could live in their waiting room. A while back I used to have a membership at one of these concierge medicine suites, and I was paying all these fees but now I realize I could have been having 10x the experience for $0 the cost at Leaf.

The front staff are friendly and everything is digital. Things that are normally done when you arrive are taken care of before you even go in (ie forms to be filled they send you before your visit and can be filled out online). Doctors and assistants are very friendly and attentive. Dr Sunwoo is amazing. They have a portal that has all your medical info if you need it that\\'s easily accessible. Highly recommend this place.

My first experience there (for an annual physical) was great- no issues at all. My second experience started out just as nicely, and I have no complaints about the doctors or medical assistants. However- all communication that requires the front desk staff is atrocious. Prior to scheduling my appointment, I called and ask to speak with a doctor about my symptoms. I was told I\\'d receive a call back. Never heard anything. I then called back to schedule an appointment anyway. At my visit, I was referred to a specialist. In order to make an appointment with the specialist\\'s office, One Leaf Medical needed to fax them over the referral sheet. Despite numerous calls to their office (both from me and from the specialist\\'s office), no fax was sent. I left messages (because they hardly ever answer their phone), and even eventually spoke with a woman at the front desk who assured me that the information would be faxed over right away. It wasn\\'t. I eventually had to fax the copy I had received myself. Then another specialist needed a pre-authorization for a related procedure. One Leaf never returned their calls, and never answered when I picked up. Once again, I had to get the information from the insurance company myself, and relay it to the specialist\\'s office. While I fully believe everyone should be an advocate for their own health, it was incredibly frustrating (and stressful) to take time out of my work day to do the job that the staff of One Leaf Medical should have done as a matter of course. While I had a decent medical experience at One Leaf, I will never go back- it was too much of a headache to work around their utter disregard for communication. Save yourself the trouble, and find an office with a more competent and responsive staff.\",aiKDY_1FByDqewNVvVEMUA\\n1/11/2018,3.0,\"It\\'s expensive, but okay if you\\'re interested in a spa like experience.\",aiKDY_1FByDqewNVvVEMUA\\n10/30/2017,1.0,\"This place is an organizational nightmare. I\\'ve called to try and make an appointment repeatedly after visiting the ER, to no avail or response. Ended up having to get emergency surgery, this was 6 weeks ago, doctor still hasn\\'t checked in on me once. On top of that, they were about to send my four dollar bill to a collections agency without ever having contacted me about it. I finally got a letter saying they\\'d emailed me about this several times, but I never received an email. When I called them to discuss this, after giving me much attitude the receptionist discovered they\\'d been sending the bill to the wrong email address!!! Barely an apology.

On the day of my appointment, after fasting per the text message instructions and canceling a meeting, received a text 3 hours prior to appointment canceling. Called in and Cathy said \"\"due to unforeseen scheduling conflicts Dr. Sunwoo cannot take new patients.\"\" Well, this was the whole reason Dr. Sunwoo and Leaf are rated high on Yelp and United Healthcare - as primary care providers who accept new patients. To Cathy\\'s credit she did call my phone 3 days prior to appointment but who listens to vms? Not sure why the website let me make an appointment, the text message system confirmed it, before Dr. Sunwoo\\'s office decided her time is more valuable than mine.

No response. I get in the door at 4:18, and am told I can\\'t see the doctor WHO IS IN THE BUILDING ANYWAY. I was told I could reschedule. Why would I re-schedule and trust this so-called doctor with my health? Her and her staff couldn\\'t even communicate with me as I tried to let them know about a problem. **If you have urgent health concerns, you should know the staff doesn\\'t seem to check the \"\"urgent\"\" email very often. The receptionist seemed surprised to find my email from 33 minutes earlier. What if your child was sick? Is 33 minutes or more OK for you to wait? ** PSI made an appointment with a new doctor. My health is too important to trust to amateurs like Dr. Gross and her staff. Sometimes this city makes you late to things, but you should be able to have open communication about it with professionals. Not these people.PPSI didn\\'t even get in to this whole other thing about getting this doctor to fill out ONE SINGLE PIECE OF PAPER that took TWO WEEKS OF FOLLOW UP.  Never again.\",aiKDY_1FByDqewNVvVEMUA\\n1/11/2019,3.0,\"First off, we loved our daughter\\'s pediatrician (Shaps).

When I finally did get through this morning (after leaving a voicemail that wasn\\'t replied to), I asked to have my child\\'s medical records sent to a new pediatrician (we moved), as we urgently need to arrange an appointment for today. I was told I needed to sign a medical release form, which I would be emailed. Two hours later, no email. Called back, no answer. Left a voicemail... still no response to that. We have had this experience several times over the two years my daughter was a patient. For the sake of people still using Leaf, hire more responsible people at the front desk.

Seriously, I can\\'t deal with this anymore. I love Dr Gross, I really do, and my in-person experience has been positive, but the inability of the office staff to complete A SIMPLE TASK such as moving my prescription from expressscripts to my local pharmacy is baffling, infuriating, and terrifying. I have had to call 5 times and explain the task again each time and they still can\\'t figure it out! I swear at this point I think they\\'re purposefully \"\"forgetting\"\" to move my prescription just to spite me. There is nothing in this world more awful than suffering without your medication because the office staff can\\'t be bothered to figure out how to resolve a simple issue.

I went to three different dentists before finding Dr. Goldman at Leaf Dental and he is wonderful. He is not subjective in his diagnosis and he thoroughly explains your current state and any reasoning for recommended next steps. He is also extremely positive and upbeat- which is appreciated at an 8am dental visit. For the medical- all doctors I have visited are great, however Dr. Mazza specifically is an angel. I hope she never leaves! She has handled sensitive health topics with extreme care, is super empathetic- and I have always been reassured by her professional opinion.

My coworker/friend recommended that I go to her since I was looking for a new general practitioner in 2016 and I\\'ve been coming here ever since. This is a concierge medical office - appointments are made on ZocDoc (or you can call the office), the office has modern decor and iPads, and patients can review their blood test results and all doctor\\'s comments on the patient portal. I travel all the way from Dyker Heights to see Dr. Sunwoo for my appointments which is a hike (about $17 Uber ride each way) but I definitely save time by going here because I\\'m always taken at my appointment time.Another reason why I switched general practitioners is because my previous doctor could never see me when I was actually sick. I was tired of being told to come in the following week because he was overbooked. I have not had that experience here. If I call with a concern, I generally get an appointment within the next 2 days.With that being said, I\\'m not sure Sunwoo is accepting new patients but there is another doctor, Valerie Gross, who I believe is taking new patients. I recommended another coworker to Leaf Medical and now Dr. Gross is her general practitioner. Dr. Gross is also a gynecologist for those looking for one as well.The office also has a dentist and pediatrics. A one stop shop for all of your medical needs. The DUMBO location is convenient for those living or working in the city.

We felt like we were checking-in to a 5 star hotel. Somebody greeted me outside and actually escorted me all the way into the office / waiting area. I think she saw that I was carrying a baby and stroller and all his stuff, and she sprung up to help. That was a first! Once we got inside, the waiting areas were really nice and there was no shortage of things to keep little Dylan occupied. This place is really really clean which is important to me when I have a 1 year old that touches literally everything. It\\'s like why do I want to bring my baby to the doctor just so he can get even sicker when he gets home. You can tell right away that they take amazing care of the facility at Leaf. Also who designed this place. It\\'s out of the world. I was joking with a friend that I could live in their waiting room. A while back I used to have a membership at one of these concierge medicine suites, and I was paying all these fees but now I realize I could have been having 10x the experience for $0 the cost at Leaf. Never again.In terms of the appointment experience, these guys were so accommodating. Not like my other Pediatrician who I felt like I had to negotiate with every time Dylan needed to be seen.

I was impressed with the trendy and clean look of the office, but I didn\\'t enjoy my time with Dr. Sunwoo.She was dismissive of some of my complaints and did not explain anything to me. I told her I was specifically concerned with one symptom and she brushed it off and basically told me what I was experiencing is normal (it\\'s not). She really drilled on me about my eating and exercise habits and while I was really open to hearing some advice and guidance, she just seemed to judge all my answers to the point that my eyes were welling up with tears (I\\'m sensitive about my weight but still...)I am also not impressed with the office and their patient portal. Dr. Sunwoo took some blood samples to test for a few things and I have been unable to access the results of these tests. They don\\'t show up in my patient portal, the office is unresponsive to my calls. I found the people who worked there to be rude and seemed to assume I was always in the wrong or didn\\'t know what I was doing.

Dr. Sunwoo was very patient and accommodating to all the questions that I had and paperwork that I needed filled out, which I may say was a LOT!! The nurses and the employees at the front desk are always so kind and helpful, even though I was probably super annoying with all my appointments and paperwork. The space is really nice and modern and the location, which is in Dumbo right near the water and is amazing.

Never again.In terms of the appointment experience, these guys were so accommodating. Not like my other Pediatrician who I felt like I had to negotiate with every time Dylan needed to be seen.

I was impressed with the trendy and clean look of the office, but I didn\\'t enjoy my time with Dr. Sunwoo.She was dismissive of some of my complaints and did not explain anything to me. I told her I was specifically concerned with one symptom and she brushed it off and basically told me what I was experiencing is normal (it\\'s not). She really drilled on me about my eating and exercise habits and while I was really open to hearing some advice and guidance, she just seemed to judge all my answers to the point that my eyes were welling up with tears (I\\'m sensitive about my weight but still...)I am also not impressed with the office and their patient portal. Dr. Sunwoo took some blood samples to test for a few things and I have been unable to access the results of these tests. They don\\'t show up in my patient portal, the office is unresponsive to my calls. I found the people who worked there to be rude and seemed to assume I was always in the wrong or didn\\'t know what I was doing.

I had needed to get a whole bunch of vaccines, blood work, and tests done and paperwork filled out for my school, since I was going into the nursing program, so I was coming here very often during that time span. Dr. Sunwoo was very patient and accommodating to all the questions that I had and paperwork that I needed filled out, which I may say was a LOT!! The nurses and the employees at the front desk are always so kind and helpful, even though I was probably super annoying with all my appointments and paperwork. The space is really nice and modern and the location, which is in Dumbo right near the water and is amazing.

My first experience there (for an annual physical) was great- no issues at all. My second experience started out just as nicely, and I have no complaints about the doctors or medical assistants. However- all communication that requires the front desk staff is atrocious. Prior to scheduling my appointment, I called and ask to speak with a doctor about my symptoms. I was told I\\'d receive a call back. Never heard anything. I then called back to schedule an appointment anyway. At my visit, I was referred to a specialist. In order to make an appointment with the specialist\\'s office, One Leaf Medical needed to fax them over the referral sheet. Despite numerous calls to their office (both from me and from the specialist\\'s office), no fax was sent. I left messages (because they hardly ever answer their phone), and even eventually spoke with a woman at the front desk who assured me that the information would be faxed over right away. It wasn\\'t. I eventually had to fax the copy I had received myself. Then another specialist needed a pre-authorization for a related procedure. One Leaf never returned their calls, and never answered when I picked up. Once again, I had to get the information from the insurance company myself, and relay it to the specialist\\'s office. While I fully believe everyone should be an advocate for their own health, it was incredibly frustrating (and stressful) to take time out of my work day to do the job that the staff of One Leaf Medical should have done as a matter of course. While I had a decent medical experience at One Leaf, I will never go back- it was too much of a headache to work around their utter disregard for communication. Save yourself the trouble, and find an office with a more competent and responsive staff.\",aiKDY_1FByDqewNVvVEMUA\\n1/11/2018,3.0,\"It\\'s expensive, but okay if you\\'re interested in a spa like experience.\",aiKDY_1FByDqewNVvVEMUA\\n10/30/2017,1.0,\"This place is an organizational nightmare.

I finally got a letter saying they\\'d emailed me about this several times, but I never received an email. When I called them to discuss this, after giving me much attitude the receptionist discovered they\\'d been sending the bill to the wrong email address!!! Barely an apology.

To Cathy\\'s credit she did call my phone 3 days prior to appointment but who listens to vms? Not sure why the website let me make an appointment, the text message system confirmed it, before Dr. Sunwoo\\'s office decided her time is more valuable than mine.

I was told I needed to sign a medical release form, which I would be emailed. Two hours later, no email. Called back, no answer. Left a voicemail... still no response to that. We have had this experience several times over the two years my daughter was a patient. For the sake of people still using Leaf, hire more responsible people at the front desk.

He is not subjective in his diagnosis and he thoroughly explains your current state and any reasoning for recommended next steps. He is also extremely positive and upbeat- which is appreciated at an 8am dental visit. For the medical- all doctors I have visited are great, however Dr. Mazza specifically is an angel. I hope she never leaves! She has handled sensitive health topics with extreme care, is super empathetic- and I have always been reassured by her professional opinion.

My coworker/friend recommended that I go to her since I was looking for a new general practitioner in 2016 and I\\'ve been coming here ever since. This is a concierge medical office - appointments are made on ZocDoc (or you can call the office), the office has modern decor and iPads, and patients can review their blood test results and all doctor\\'s comments on the patient portal. I travel all the way from Dyker Heights to see Dr. Sunwoo for my appointments which is a hike (about $17 Uber ride each way) but I definitely save time by going here because I\\'m always taken at my appointment time.Another reason why I switched general practitioners is because my previous doctor could never see me when I was actually sick. I was tired of being told to come in the following week because he was overbooked. I have not had that experience here. If I call with a concern, I generally get an appointment within the next 2 days.With that being said, I\\'m not sure Sunwoo is accepting new patients but there is another doctor, Valerie Gross, who I believe is taking new patients. I recommended another coworker to Leaf Medical and now Dr. Gross is her general practitioner. Dr. Gross is also a gynecologist for those looking for one as well.The office also has a dentist and pediatrics. A one stop shop for all of your medical needs. The DUMBO location is convenient for those living or working in the city. For those who live further out into Brooklyn, the Uber ride is worth it.Note: the office is only open on Saturdays to those who have a certain type of membership.

He is also extremely positive and upbeat- which is appreciated at an 8am dental visit. For the medical- all doctors I have visited are great, however Dr. Mazza specifically is an angel. I hope she never leaves! She has handled sensitive health topics with extreme care, is super empathetic- and I have always been reassured by her professional opinion. She approaches medicine by assessing an individual\\'s overall wellbeing as opposed to a solely scientific approach- and our mental and physical health has benefited tremendously from her approach. This place is a gem! Don\\'t hesitate to go!\",aiKDY_1FByDqewNVvVEMUA\\n12/27/2017,4.0,\"I love Leaf Medical and Dr. Sunwoo. My coworker/friend recommended that I go to her since I was looking for a new general practitioner in 2016 and I\\'ve been coming here ever since. This is a concierge medical office - appointments are made on ZocDoc (or you can call the office), the office has modern decor and iPads, and patients can review their blood test results and all doctor\\'s comments on the patient portal. I travel all the way from Dyker Heights to see Dr. Sunwoo for my appointments which is a hike (about $17 Uber ride each way) but I definitely save time by going here because I\\'m always taken at my appointment time.Another reason why I switched general practitioners is because my previous doctor could never see me when I was actually sick. I was tired of being told to come in the following week because he was overbooked. I have not had that experience here. If I call with a concern, I generally get an appointment within the next 2 days.With that being said, I\\'m not sure Sunwoo is accepting new patients but there is another doctor, Valerie Gross, who I believe is taking new patients. I recommended another coworker to Leaf Medical and now Dr. Gross is her general practitioner. Dr. Gross is also a gynecologist for those looking for one as well.The office also has a dentist and pediatrics. A one stop shop for all of your medical needs. The DUMBO location is convenient for those living or working in the city. For those who live further out into Brooklyn, the Uber ride is worth it.Note: the office is only open on Saturdays to those who have a certain type of membership. I tried to apply for this once but I was told they are at capacity so look to schedule your appointments during the week.\",aiKDY_1FByDqewNVvVEMUA\\n4/23/2018,2.0,\"Took 3 calls to get an appointment despite repeatedly attempting to schedule through their online portal.

Shady.\",aiKDY_1FByDqewNVvVEMUA\\n7/19/2018,5.0,\"Woah, this place is amazing. I took my 1-year old (and myself) for an appointment here. It was our first time, but man I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever been to a nicer and more caring medical office...ever. First of all the staff here are so great. We felt like we were checking-in to a 5 star hotel. Somebody greeted me outside and actually escorted me all the way into the office / waiting area. I think she saw that I was carrying a baby and stroller and all his stuff, and she sprung up to help. That was a first! Once we got inside, the waiting areas were really nice and there was no shortage of things to keep little Dylan occupied. This place is really really clean which is important to me when I have a 1 year old that touches literally everything. It\\'s like why do I want to bring my baby to the doctor just so he can get even sicker when he gets home. You can tell right away that they take amazing care of the facility at Leaf. Also who designed this place. It\\'s out of the world. I was joking with a friend that I could live in their waiting room. A while back I used to have a membership at one of these concierge medicine suites, and I was paying all these fees but now I realize I could have been having 10x the experience for $0 the cost at Leaf. Never again.In terms of the appointment experience, these guys were so accommodating. Not like my other Pediatrician who I felt like I had to negotiate with every time Dylan needed to be seen. Dr. Valerie Gross and Dr. Janelle Sunwoo were both so great. I can\\'t speak to the other physicians, but you cannot go wrong with either of these two amazing doctors.\",aiKDY_1FByDqewNVvVEMUA\\n12/13/2017,2.0,\"I had an odd experience with Dr. Sunwoo and this office in general. I went in for a yearly physical as a new patient, fully expecting to have found my new primary care. I was impressed with the trendy and clean look of the office, but I didn\\'t enjoy my time with Dr. Sunwoo.She was dismissive of some of my complaints and did not explain anything to me. I told her I was specifically concerned with one symptom and she brushed it off and basically told me what I was experiencing is normal (it\\'s not). She really drilled on me about my eating and exercise habits and while I was really open to hearing some advice and guidance, she just seemed to judge all my answers to the point that my eyes were welling up with tears (I\\'m sensitive about my weight but still...)I am also not impressed with the office and their patient portal. Dr. Sunwoo took some blood samples to test for a few things and I have been unable to access the results of these tests. They don\\'t show up in my patient portal, the office is unresponsive to my calls. I found the people who worked there to be rude and seemed to assume I was always in the wrong or didn\\'t know what I was doing.

I had needed to get a whole bunch of vaccines, blood work, and tests done and paperwork filled out for my school, since I was going into the nursing program, so I was coming here very often during that time span. Dr. Sunwoo was very patient and accommodating to all the questions that I had and paperwork that I needed filled out, which I may say was a LOT!! The nurses and the employees at the front desk are always so kind and helpful, even though I was probably super annoying with all my appointments and paperwork. The space is really nice and modern and the location, which is in Dumbo right near the water and is amazing.

My first experience there (for an annual physical) was great- no issues at all. My second experience started out just as nicely, and I have no complaints about the doctors or medical assistants. However- all communication that requires the front desk staff is atrocious. Prior to scheduling my appointment, I called and ask to speak with a doctor about my symptoms. I was told I\\'d receive a call back. Never heard anything. I then called back to schedule an appointment anyway. At my visit, I was referred to a specialist. In order to make an appointment with the specialist\\'s office, One Leaf Medical needed to fax them over the referral sheet. Despite numerous calls to their office (both from me and from the specialist\\'s office), no fax was sent. I left messages (because they hardly ever answer their phone), and even eventually spoke with a woman at the front desk who assured me that the information would be faxed over right away. It wasn\\'t. I eventually had to fax the copy I had received myself. Then another specialist needed a pre-authorization for a related procedure. One Leaf never returned their calls, and never answered when I picked up. Once again, I had to get the information from the insurance company myself, and relay it to the specialist\\'s office. While I fully believe everyone should be an advocate for their own health, it was incredibly frustrating (and stressful) to take time out of my work day to do the job that the staff of One Leaf Medical should have done as a matter of course. While I had a decent medical experience at One Leaf, I will never go back- it was too much of a headache to work around their utter disregard for communication. Save yourself the trouble, and find an office with a more competent and responsive staff.\",aiKDY_1FByDqewNVvVEMUA\\n1/11/2018,3.0,\"It\\'s expensive, but okay if you\\'re interested in a spa like experience.\",aiKDY_1FByDqewNVvVEMUA\\n10/30/2017,1.0,\"This place is an organizational nightmare.

Called in and Cathy said \"\"due to unforeseen scheduling conflicts Dr. Sunwoo cannot take new patients.\"\" Well, this was the whole reason Dr. Sunwoo and Leaf are rated high on Yelp and United Healthcare - as primary care providers who accept new patients. To Cathy\\'s credit she did call my phone 3 days prior to appointment but who listens to vms? Not sure why the website let me make an appointment, the text message system confirmed it, before Dr. Sunwoo\\'s office decided her time is more valuable than mine.

Sometimes this city makes you late to things, but you should be able to have open communication about it with professionals.

I was told I needed to sign a medical release form, which I would be emailed. Two hours later, no email. Called back, no answer. Left a voicemail... still no response to that.

He gave me a call at 9:30pm and left me a very detailed voicemail which was most helpful as I was uncomfortable with what I thought I understood from the visit.

He took the time to ask me specific questions about my family\\'s medical history and took the time to answer my questions and kept asking me if I had any other questions. Most doctors are usually trying to push you out the door. As someone who works crazy work hours I also appreciated how instead of coming in for my check-up results and waiting in the waiting room for hours on end just to hear everything is ok which has been done to me many a time in the past, he personally returned my phone call and reviewed my results over the phone.

I felt well taken care of, well informed, and prepared to make clear decisions for my health.The check in/check out process was also a dream. So easy and the staff is friendly.

It causes me all sorts of anxiety. Anxiety that they will find something super wrong with me when I didn\\'t realize I had a problem or that they will find nothing wrong with me when I am convinced there is a major issue.  Sigh. So I finally relented to my mom\\'s constant nagging to get a PCP and made an appointment at the NYU Langone Medical Center. My aunt sees a PCP here and recommended the practice. I let them choose who I was seeing since I didn\\'t care either way. Honestly the doctor my aunt sees looked a little mean from the website so I didn\\'t ask to see her. Haha. Anyway, when you first check in they give you a piece of paper explaining the ONLINE patient system. You can see your medical records and test results, email the doctor and a whole slue of other stuff. Dr. Taylor told me I can email her through the online system if I have a medical issue and she can determine if she wants to see me in person or not. How useful is that! The assistant who asked me questions before the doctor came in had a thick accent and I couldn\\'t entirely understand the questions she was asking me. Also, I really didn\\'t like that they asked me out loud how my grandparents died. Way to make me relive each of those memories. Dr. Taylor was amazingly nice and has a great bedside manner. She talked to me about my diet and allergies and made recommendations without sounding forceful. I really enjoyed my interaction with her and will definitely be keeping her as my PCP.I had to go for bloodwork as part of the physical and it was totally painless. It took less than 3 minutes and they asked me which lab my insurance prefers so I called them ahead of time to have that information. If you are a new patient you should print the new patient forms off of the website to save yourself some time. It took me a while to collect all of that information! But if you are filling it out in the waiting room...enjoy the complimentary Keurig coffee! Also, I learned my lesson the hard way to know about your co-pays if that isn\\'t printed on your insurance card. They accidentally overcharged me by $10 and they said I have to wait 6-8 weeks to be reimbursed that money. Not the end of the world but a little irritating.This is a great location if you work or live in the financial district but a bit out of the way otherwise.\",5GxXKFcqEzKv0yyQ19kXww\\n2/18/2014,5.0,\"I have TREMENDOUS doctor anxiety, and still actually enjoyed the experience I had with Dr. Taylor and the helpful staff at Brooklyn Mt.

After an insurance mix-up which the office handled beautifully (not their fault at all, and they changed me to a within the hour appointment that saved me easily $100!!), I was able to see Dr. Taylor for a visit that was quick, thorough, and totally put me at ease.

I will continue choosing her because she\\'s great.

No more talking to receptionists whose sole job is to run interference and prevent you from trying to get in touch with your doctor. Their online system includes a nifty little email tool that you use to send messages to the doctor who sees you - Dr. Taylor, for example, replied back to my email in under 2 hours. When the doctor sends you an email back, the online tool in turn sends you an email (the one you use when you sign up) about it. All of your tests, prescriptions etc. etc, info can be found online. You can even request a prescription refill online, book an appointment, cancel an appointment etc. Very nice.What\\'s NOT cool is the nosy and super inquisitive questions they ask every new patient..sorry, but I fail to see how it helps the doctor for a routine appointment by knowing how many times a week I have sex, when was the last time I had it or whether my preferred sexual partner is female or male (yes, they asked me that one too!)\",5GxXKFcqEzKv0yyQ19kXww\\n9/6/2017,5.0,\"I\\'ve been delighted with Dr. Guderian as my primary care doctor.

I said \"\"no.\"\" I reminded her that she did tests to check that. I thought that, in itself, was odd but I let her do that. She said she was asking about the past. I reiterated that I never took drugs. She said that her computer said that I took drugs. I asked who said that. She said she could not tell me. I was quite annoyed.

I will reserve most discussion of that matter for a later review of One Medical, where it belongs. Of relevance here is that Dr. Guderian did an outstanding job of graciously and tactfully facilitating resolution of a problem that she had done nothing at all to cause. I\\'m extremely grateful to her for that, and her employer should be too.Indeed with the one exception mentioned above, the remaining staff working with Dr. Guderian have been consistently courteous, compassionate and professional.

I told them I thought I needed a prescription called in for at least asthma medication if not antibiotics because the infection was so persistent and I was having breathing probs.  The doctor refused to call me back.  Instead I got a callous and flat return call from the receptionist stating that the doctor would not speak to me unless i came in person.  I explained twice that i would not be able to make it up the subway stairs to them unless they at least sent my prescription to the local pharmacy. This was something that Irene Park had said would be possible for them to do given my long history of asthma.  I asked him if they really thought it was better for me to take some expired medications to be able to manage to travel to their office.  No response. You could hear the guy shrug.  Zero concern. Zero compassion. Zero follow up.

Never had this happen during a routine physical.- One of the said tests was a \"\"lung capacity\"\" test which to me seems like junk when he already learned I was a non-smoker with no history of asthma, work out regularly, and I\\'m still young.- Also, this Dr. apparently leads his patients to believe the BMI is a good indicator which I called him out on since I know what it is and he admitted it only considers your height and weight. FYI, a lot of professional athletes would be considered \"\"overweight\"\" by this non-sense measure if they have a lot of muscle mass.Bottom line: this guy is a marketer with an M.D. I have no problem with a doctor making a good living, but please don\\'t be \"\"upselling\"\" me on your products like you\\'re a server!\",XQFPw5mlnOSXIwrNZoF8cg\\n9/2/2014,5.0,\"Love Dr. Lutsky and his team!

Once I had an emergency, he responded very fast and was helpful and supportive. I have met Erika a couple of times and she seems lovely and competent, too.

Dr Lutsky is both a talented diagnostician and a down to earth man who treats patients fairly, honestly and with compassion. As noted by others, he does not rush patients in/out - so sometimes that means you may have to wait a bit. While I have been on the receiving end of this (waiting) in my 20 years I understand what\\'s behind it. His office staff is long- tenured and Sherri and Wilson have been part of the team a long time.

This is very important to me, because I tend to ask a lot of questions, specifically about preventative care. His nurse practitioner, Irene Park, is very friendly and also will listen carefully to any questions you may have and will give you very helpful answers.

My wife called Dr. Todd McNiff while dealing with serious flu symptoms. \"\"Dr Todd\"\" is her primary care physician and one would assume he would be concerned for an ill patient. My wife has had a difficult history with asthma as well as numerous bouts of pneumonia. This was way beyond a case of the sniffles. His team was completely dismissive of her problems and told her she would not be able to see the doctor for two weeks. Ok - fine. Appointments may be difficult to schedule, I get that. What was more disconcerting was the fact that they declined to offer to refer her to another doctor or medical professional, refused to offer any helpful advice over the phone and basically told her that she was welcome to find another primary care physician if she was dissatisfied with their service. To which I say - WHAT SERVICE?I was appalled to hear of how she was treated. She eventually was seen by Urgent Care who could not have been more helpful. Not only did Urgent Care see her immediately, they also called to follow up to see how she was feeling. For a walk-in patient.

Still not feeling well (actually feeling worse), I had my exam and waited for test results. On February 14th, I sent a message on the patient portal because the results are usually posted for patients to see. Jeremy at the front desk sends a message right back to say that they were posted and that the doctor would contact me about my thyroid results. I look through my tests and see that the thyroid test was out of range, so I responded to him asking \"\"When?\"\". Absolutely no response. I called the next day and get told that he will call me. No phone call. I called again a day or two later. No phone call. 15 days later, I sent another message: \"\"15 days and counting...am I ever going to hear from Dr. Mcniff?\"\" No response.Today it is 4 days shy of a month and STILL no call. Wtf?? I called earlier today and was told once again that she will give him the message. I told her what is going on and that he never called me. I also told her that if they send me any bill (though I am pretty sure it\\'s all paid up), that I will withhold any payment until I get a call. She says that she will let him know. No call today. Seriously...I left my old doctor (whom used to work in the same practice as Dr. Mcniff) because he never told me the results of the asthma test that he sent me to take and then told me five months later when I was in his office that I tested moderate for asthma. What the hell is wrong with these doctors?? Don\\'t they care about treating patients? Or is this just a New York thing where there are so many people that doctors just don\\'t give a shit anymore?I took myself to City MD to go get a full thyroid panel.

Last time I was there I asked Dr. McNiff if he knew my blood type and he didn\\'t as it wasn\\'t in my chart. I have no real reason to know my blood type but my wife and family know theirs and I\\'ve always been curious about mine was so I wanted to know. Since I was there for blood work for something else I asked if he could have the test taken so I could find out mine. He reminded me there was no legit reason I would need to know my blood type but I just reminded him I still wanted to know so he said ok. Neither results were urgent so I completely forgot about them until months later I remembered I had that test and neither Dr. McNiff nor his office contacted me about the results. When I finally got the results I noticed nothing about my blood type. When I asked about this the doctor told me he never ordered the test because there wasn\\'t any reason for me to know it. I felt like I was in a Twilight Zone episode. He said if I wanted to make an appointment to come back in he\\'d order the test. Another appointment and bill for something I had already asked for previously? No thank you. Another thing is that I was under the impression that I could email Dr. McNiff with questions or concerns, when I first started going here years ago I remember sending him an email once and getting a quick response but this past year I sent an email that went unanswered for weeks. A follow up email was answered with an apology but when I responded to that email with another question, it too was never answered. Mohawk Village Medical\\'s website has a link to a patient portal so I thought that would be a better way to electronically communicate with them but after signing up for it I noticed they disabled the messaging feature of the portal. Ok so they aren\\'t good with any type of electronic communication. It\\'s certainly unfortunately in this day and age and for my lifestyle but it\\'s not unheard of. So I had time sensitive question that went unanswered in email so ended up calling the office. The receptionist was nice but unhelpful in answering my question that was for the doctor. I told the receptionist that I had emailed the Dr. and if he could tell him to check his email and get back to me as soon as possible by either phone or email. I was told he would pass that message on.

Their staff, while often extremely busy, are helpful and kind, even via email.Dr. McNiff always has been and still is the type of person who advocates for his patients. He\\'s that rare doctor who does what he does because he truly cares.

First of all, they treat you like an actual person here- Dr. McNiff really takes the time to explain things to me, patiently hear me out on my (mildly hypochondriacal) concerns, and get to know me. That\\'s even true for front desk staff, who remember my name and greet me the minute I walk in the door. I have been basically rushed out the door at other places, or have felt sort of dismissed, but have never felt that here. They\\'ve also been super accommodating of my busy schedule, squeezing me in for a short visit when I had strep throat or needed a TB test for work. The office manager, Ethan, is super friendly and always chats with me in the waiting room.It\\'s clear that they really care about the patients, even down to small details like having free umbrellas by the door in case it\\'s raining! I highly recommend this practice to anyone in need of a GP. This place feels like it\\'s out of a bygone era, when doctors actually had relationships with patients instead of treating them like insurance claims.\",-kfVnMHXVfo_f-4iqL_rtw\\n9/23/2015,5.0,\"Five stars indeed, this practice most certainly deserves it.I saw Dr. McNiff for a standard check-up. First time patient, and he took the time to hear my questions, and was very understanding of my current financial situation (don\\'t have insurance but do get a small health stipend each month from my job). He assured me that barring some extreme situation, he and his office would be willing to work with me going forward to not break the bank for regular medical visits and services. Very cool. Great bedside manner, and you could tell he genuinely cares about doing right by his patients.Just called him again today concerning what could be a small break or nasty sprain in my ankle (muay thai ain\\'t no joke!) and he assured me, after asking some questions about the injury, that it would likely simply be a matter of time for it to heal and that no special care was required. No need to come in to see him just to hear that. Saved me a lot of time and money. Again, testament to the fact that good doctoring, not profiting, is the primary goal of Mohawk Medical. Great support staff too - always friendly and able to answer questions, or get me in touch with the doc if need be. They also have an online health platform to keep all your info organized and easy to access. All in all, highly recommended.

The receptionist offered to reschedule my appointment for *today*. Alleged reason for the cancellation was the doctor now simply planned not to be in the office from Wednesday to Friday of this week -- forcing his receptionist to call all scheduled patients from Wed-Fri to cancel. The same reason was given for last week\\'s cancellation: the doctor simply planned not to come in. If your schedule happened to get messed up as a result of this doctor\\'s whim, c\\'est la vie.Completely unprofessional. One cancellation in as many weeks happens. Two cancellations in consecutive weeks without any reason other than \"\"not coming in\"\" is inconsiderate, arrogant, and the hallmark of someone who runs a disorganized medical practice.

They take the time to explain why they prescribe or diagnose something so that I understand exactly what\\'s happening in my body, without talking to me as though I\\'m a child. I suppose what I appreciate most from them is that they are incredibly respectful of me and my medical needs, without judgment of my lifestyle. For example, I\\'m a smoker, and doctors I have seen in the past have chided me for it or lectured me about it, but the doctors here didn\\'t judge or scold, but instead mentioned that if I make the decision to quit, they can help. In addition to the doctors, the office staff is also phenomenal. They are fun and attentive and make going to the doctor much more enjoyable than it should be. I changed insurance companies recently and my new insurance didn\\'t cover some of my prescriptions, so I called the office and Ethan took the time to find out what I could take that would be covered and then called in the prescriptions to my pharmacy for me without hesitation.

My wife called Dr. Todd McNiff while dealing with serious flu symptoms. \"\"Dr Todd\"\" is her primary care physician and one would assume he would be concerned for an ill patient. My wife has had a difficult history with asthma as well as numerous bouts of pneumonia. This was way beyond a case of the sniffles. His team was completely dismissive of her problems and told her she would not be able to see the doctor for two weeks. Ok - fine. Appointments may be difficult to schedule, I get that. What was more disconcerting was the fact that they declined to offer to refer her to another doctor or medical professional, refused to offer any helpful advice over the phone and basically told her that she was welcome to find another primary care physician if she was dissatisfied with their service. To which I say - WHAT SERVICE?I was appalled to hear of how she was treated. She eventually was seen by Urgent Care who could not have been more helpful. Not only did Urgent Care see her immediately, they also called to follow up to see how she was feeling. For a walk-in patient. Appalling.\",-kfVnMHXVfo_f-4iqL_rtw\\n8/8/2018,5.0,\"Excellent medical practice. I\\'ve been seeing Dr. Godwin for several months and she is one of the best doctors I have encountered.

The online patient portal lets the doctor send you notes on lab results explaining them to you (in addition to all of the numbers), which is much better than just getting a summary or numbers.

Let me start by saying this: I had been going to Dr. Mcniff for around six years, usually just for my yearly physicals, but the last two years or so, I\\'ve been having issues with not feeling well, so I\\'ve gone a few extra times...getting no results.Cut ahead to the end of January 2018, when I went in for a physical before I move from NY. Still not feeling well (actually feeling worse), I had my exam and waited for test results. On February 14th, I sent a message on the patient portal because the results are usually posted for patients to see. Jeremy at the front desk sends a message right back to say that they were posted and that the doctor would contact me about my thyroid results. I look through my tests and see that the thyroid test was out of range, so I responded to him asking \"\"When?\"\". Absolutely no response. I called the next day and get told that he will call me. No phone call. I called again a day or two later. No phone call. 15 days later, I sent another message: \"\"15 days and counting...am I ever going to hear from Dr. Mcniff?\"\" No response.Today it is 4 days shy of a month and STILL no call. Wtf?? I called earlier today and was told once again that she will give him the message. I told her what is going on and that he never called me. I also told her that if they send me any bill (though I am pretty sure it\\'s all paid up), that I will withhold any payment until I get a call. She says that she will let him know. No call today. Seriously...I left my old doctor (whom used to work in the same practice as Dr. Mcniff) because he never told me the results of the asthma test that he sent me to take and then told me five months later when I was in his office that I tested moderate for asthma. What the hell is wrong with these doctors?? Don\\'t they care about treating patients? Or is this just a New York thing where there are so many people that doctors just don\\'t give a shit anymore?I took myself to City MD to go get a full thyroid panel.

Not Dr. McNiff. He would not prescribe you anything more or less than what you need. He is one of the rare doctors where he consistently makes you feel like he has your interests in mind over money.

Thanks, Doc!\",-kfVnMHXVfo_f-4iqL_rtw\\n1/6/2017,2.0,\"Mohawk Medical is certainly a nice little office and Dr. McNiff and his staff are incredibly kind but I\\'ve just had a string of interactions that left me with a bad taste in my mouth wanting something better. Last time I was there I asked Dr. McNiff if he knew my blood type and he didn\\'t as it wasn\\'t in my chart. I have no real reason to know my blood type but my wife and family know theirs and I\\'ve always been curious about mine was so I wanted to know. Since I was there for blood work for something else I asked if he could have the test taken so I could find out mine. He reminded me there was no legit reason I would need to know my blood type but I just reminded him I still wanted to know so he said ok. Neither results were urgent so I completely forgot about them until months later I remembered I had that test and neither Dr. McNiff nor his office contacted me about the results. When I finally got the results I noticed nothing about my blood type. When I asked about this the doctor told me he never ordered the test because there wasn\\'t any reason for me to know it. I felt like I was in a Twilight Zone episode. He said if I wanted to make an appointment to come back in he\\'d order the test. Another appointment and bill for something I had already asked for previously? No thank you. Another thing is that I was under the impression that I could email Dr. McNiff with questions or concerns, when I first started going here years ago I remember sending him an email once and getting a quick response but this past year I sent an email that went unanswered for weeks. A follow up email was answered with an apology but when I responded to that email with another question, it too was never answered. Mohawk Village Medical\\'s website has a link to a patient portal so I thought that would be a better way to electronically communicate with them but after signing up for it I noticed they disabled the messaging feature of the portal. Ok so they aren\\'t good with any type of electronic communication. It\\'s certainly unfortunately in this day and age and for my lifestyle but it\\'s not unheard of. So I had time sensitive question that went unanswered in email so ended up calling the office. The receptionist was nice but unhelpful in answering my question that was for the doctor. I told the receptionist that I had emailed the Dr. and if he could tell him to check his email and get back to me as soon as possible by either phone or email. I was told he would pass that message on. Well I never got an email response or phone call back, it\\'s now weeks later so I\\'m here on Yelp updating my original review for the practice and seeing if there\\'s a better reviewed doctor/practice worth considering.\",-kfVnMHXVfo_f-4iqL_rtw\\n1/20/2017,1.0,\"I went for an annual check-up.

The office doesn\\'t feel \"\"clean\"\". One star is the delivery of test results - all in email and sign into an account. like the convenience.So - what\\'s the bad part is the changing of clothes. Usually they put you in a room to change and put the cover on, then the doctor comes in. But in McNiff\\'s office, he told me to take off my clothes behind those medical room dividers (which is IN his office and kind of short and skinny) I TOTALLY did NOT feel comfortable doing that, with no \"\"background noise\"\" to mask the clothes off sounds, it\\'s quite embarrassing. Not sure if the lighting casted a shadow of me \"\"stripping\"\" behind the curtains. But I definitely felt very UNEASY. Asked my other friends, they all thought it was weird too, not just me. I felt borderline humiliated changing my clothes like this...Also - after all those tests are done, i had to dispute the bill chargings with the receptionist.

That kind of personal attention and care is rare these days, which makes me recommend this office even more. Thanks, Doc!\",-kfVnMHXVfo_f-4iqL_rtw\\n1/6/2017,2.0,\"Mohawk Medical is certainly a nice little office and Dr. McNiff and his staff are incredibly kind but I\\'ve just had a string of interactions that left me with a bad taste in my mouth wanting something better. Last time I was there I asked Dr. McNiff if he knew my blood type and he didn\\'t as it wasn\\'t in my chart. I have no real reason to know my blood type but my wife and family know theirs and I\\'ve always been curious about mine was so I wanted to know. Since I was there for blood work for something else I asked if he could have the test taken so I could find out mine. He reminded me there was no legit reason I would need to know my blood type but I just reminded him I still wanted to know so he said ok. Neither results were urgent so I completely forgot about them until months later I remembered I had that test and neither Dr. McNiff nor his office contacted me about the results. When I finally got the results I noticed nothing about my blood type. When I asked about this the doctor told me he never ordered the test because there wasn\\'t any reason for me to know it. I felt like I was in a Twilight Zone episode. He said if I wanted to make an appointment to come back in he\\'d order the test. Another appointment and bill for something I had already asked for previously? No thank you. Another thing is that I was under the impression that I could email Dr. McNiff with questions or concerns, when I first started going here years ago I remember sending him an email once and getting a quick response but this past year I sent an email that went unanswered for weeks. A follow up email was answered with an apology but when I responded to that email with another question, it too was never answered. Mohawk Village Medical\\'s website has a link to a patient portal so I thought that would be a better way to electronically communicate with them but after signing up for it I noticed they disabled the messaging feature of the portal. Ok so they aren\\'t good with any type of electronic communication. It\\'s certainly unfortunately in this day and age and for my lifestyle but it\\'s not unheard of. So I had time sensitive question that went unanswered in email so ended up calling the office. The receptionist was nice but unhelpful in answering my question that was for the doctor. I told the receptionist that I had emailed the Dr. and if he could tell him to check his email and get back to me as soon as possible by either phone or email. I was told he would pass that message on. Well I never got an email response or phone call back, it\\'s now weeks later so I\\'m here on Yelp updating my original review for the practice and seeing if there\\'s a better reviewed doctor/practice worth considering.\",-kfVnMHXVfo_f-4iqL_rtw\\n1/20/2017,1.0,\"I went for an annual check-up. They asked for my credit card (I have insurance that completely covers preventive care). I told them to contact me if there are extra charges. I wouldn\\'t expect there to be, it\\'s a routine check-up.That was in May. Six months later, I\\'m getting letters from debt collectors telling me it stems from this office visit. Called the office and sent multiple emails, no answer. Insane. Potential impact on my credit history and no one who\\'s willing to sort through it. Stay away, not worth the hassle for a check-up.\",-kfVnMHXVfo_f-4iqL_rtw\\n5/26/2017,1.0,\"I went there for the first time because it was a good location from me. The office is like a 2 big bedroom apartment. McNiff has one, and Godwin-Gorga has one. The room is like an office and medical examination room in one - which is kinda weird. The office doesn\\'t feel \"\"clean\"\". One star is the delivery of test results - all in email and sign into an account. like the convenience.So - what\\'s the bad part is the changing of clothes. Usually they put you in a room to change and put the cover on, then the doctor comes in. But in McNiff\\'s office, he told me to take off my clothes behind those medical room dividers (which is IN his office and kind of short and skinny) I TOTALLY did NOT feel comfortable doing that, with no \"\"background noise\"\" to mask the clothes off sounds, it\\'s quite embarrassing. Not sure if the lighting casted a shadow of me \"\"stripping\"\" behind the curtains. But I definitely felt very UNEASY. Asked my other friends, they all thought it was weird too, not just me. I felt borderline humiliated changing my clothes like this...Also - after all those tests are done, i had to dispute the bill chargings with the receptionist. We were both a bit heated in the end and he just gave me \"\"I didn\\'t have time for this\"\" attitude and just hung up on me.\",-kfVnMHXVfo_f-4iqL_rtw\\n12/22/2015,1.0,DO NOT GO HERE....YOU WILL BE CHEATED TOO.Dr. Todd Mcniff needs to learn what tests he needs to order for his patients. I went to him for annual physical examination and he ordered a bunch of tests that were not covered and not required. I had no knowledge of this happening until i got bills from the lab saying I have to pay them else my credit score will be affected.I am being totally cheated as there was no need for Dr. Todd to requests those tests. His office had my insurance details and this is part of his job to know what to request the lab. Very unprofessional and poor attitude towards patients.,-kfVnMHXVfo_f-4iqL_rtw\\n5/23/2016,5.0,\"I have been seeing Dr Todd for a few weeks now, and I have nothing but good things to say about him!His office staff is very helpful and kind,and Dr Todd has been helping me with my foot for weeks and makes me feel very reassured that he is doing all that he can for me.I highly recommend him! He is a great DR.His office is clean and modern and located in a great area as well.\",-kfVnMHXVfo_f-4iqL_rtw\\n12/7/2016,5.0,\"Let\\'s be clear here: My husband and I are one of the original patients of Dr. McNiff before he ever moved to his newer location and started his own practice. We are also extremely understanding and reasonable people, so we get how hard he works (it\\'s plain to see), how much he cares about people, and how occasionally, a couple of patients may exploit or misunderstand that due to unrealistic or inappropriate expectations. With all that being said, if you\\'re a new or potential patient of Dr. McNiff or Dr. Godwin, expect a different experience than you\\'ve had previously. Both doctors will talk to you like you are a human being. They will not blindly prescribe you medications and if they advise lab tests, it is because they have a reasonable, educated concern or need to rule things out. Their staff, while often extremely busy, are helpful and kind, even via email.Dr. McNiff always has been and still is the type of person who advocates for his patients. He\\'s that rare doctor who does what he does because he truly cares. My husband and I have endless respect for him and his colleagues.\",-kfVnMHXVfo_f-4iqL_rtw\\n3/15/2016,5.0,\"I have been coming to Dr. McNiff basically since the practice opened a few years back, and have had nothing but amazing experiences here. First of all, they treat you like an actual person here- Dr. McNiff really takes the time to explain things to me, patiently hear me out on my (mildly hypochondriacal) concerns, and get to know me. That\\'s even true for front desk staff, who remember my name and greet me the minute I walk in the door. I have been basically rushed out the door at other places, or have felt sort of dismissed, but have never felt that here. They\\'ve also been super accommodating of my busy schedule, squeezing me in for a short visit when I had strep throat or needed a TB test for work. The office manager, Ethan, is super friendly and always chats with me in the waiting room.It\\'s clear that they really care about the patients, even down to small details like having free umbrellas by the door in case it\\'s raining! I highly recommend this practice to anyone in need of a GP. This place feels like it\\'s out of a bygone era, when doctors actually had relationships with patients instead of treating them like insurance claims.\",-kfVnMHXVfo_f-4iqL_rtw\\n9/23/2015,5.0,\"Five stars indeed, this practice most certainly deserves it.I saw Dr. McNiff for a standard check-up. First time patient, and he took the time to hear my questions, and was very understanding of my current financial situation (don\\'t have insurance but do get a small health stipend each month from my job). He assured me that barring some extreme situation, he and his office would be willing to work with me going forward to not break the bank for regular medical visits and services. Very cool. Great bedside manner, and you could tell he genuinely cares about doing right by his patients.Just called him again today concerning what could be a small break or nasty sprain in my ankle (muay thai ain\\'t no joke!) and he assured me, after asking some questions about the injury, that it would likely simply be a matter of time for it to heal and that no special care was required. No need to come in to see him just to hear that. Saved me a lot of time and money. Again, testament to the fact that good doctoring, not profiting, is the primary goal of Mohawk Medical. Great support staff too - always friendly and able to answer questions, or get me in touch with the doc if need be. They also have an online health platform to keep all your info organized and easy to access. All in all, highly recommended. Glad I found my primary physician here in NYC.\",-kfVnMHXVfo_f-4iqL_rtw\\n12/27/2016,1.0,\"Got a call around 9:40 this morning canceling my appointment tomorrow (12/28) for a check-up/physical for the second time in two weeks. The receptionist offered to reschedule my appointment for *today*. Alleged reason for the cancellation was the doctor now simply planned not to be in the office from Wednesday to Friday of this week -- forcing his receptionist to call all scheduled patients from Wed-Fri to cancel. The same reason was given for last week\\'s cancellation: the doctor simply planned not to come in. If your schedule happened to get messed up as a result of this doctor\\'s whim, c\\'est la vie.Completely unprofessional. One cancellation in as many weeks happens. Two cancellations in consecutive weeks without any reason other than \"\"not coming in\"\" is inconsiderate, arrogant, and the hallmark of someone who runs a disorganized medical practice. I\\'ll avoid this doctor going forward. The least a solo practitioner can do is maintain an honest schedule and communicate with his/her patients about changes in a timely manner. Here, you cannot get even that.\",-kfVnMHXVfo_f-4iqL_rtw\\n3/21/2016,5.0,\"I can\\'t say enough good things about Dr. Godwin and Dr. McNiff. I have been going to them for years and can\\'t imagine seeing anyone else. They take the time to explain why they prescribe or diagnose something so that I understand exactly what\\'s happening in my body, without talking to me as though I\\'m a child. I suppose what I appreciate most from them is that they are incredibly respectful of me and my medical needs, without judgment of my lifestyle. For example, I\\'m a smoker, and doctors I have seen in the past have chided me for it or lectured me about it, but the doctors here didn\\'t judge or scold, but instead mentioned that if I make the decision to quit, they can help. In addition to the doctors, the office staff is also phenomenal. They are fun and attentive and make going to the doctor much more enjoyable than it should be. I changed insurance companies recently and my new insurance didn\\'t cover some of my prescriptions, so I called the office and Ethan took the time to find out what I could take that would be covered and then called in the prescriptions to my pharmacy for me without hesitation. I can\\'t imagine getting better care anywhere else, and I have referred many of my friends here, as well.And while this doesn\\'t affect the level of care I receive, it is worth noting that they play great music in the office.\",-kfVnMHXVfo_f-4iqL_rtw\\n12/3/2018,5.0,\"5 stars for doctors Elizabeth and Praisy, 1 star for the reception staff.

My wife called Dr. Todd McNiff while dealing with serious flu symptoms. \"\"Dr Todd\"\" is her primary care physician and one would assume he would be concerned for an ill patient. My wife has had a difficult history with asthma as well as numerous bouts of pneumonia. This was way beyond a case of the sniffles. His team was completely dismissive of her problems and told her she would not be able to see the doctor for two weeks. Ok - fine. Appointments may be difficult to schedule, I get that. What was more disconcerting was the fact that they declined to offer to refer her to another doctor or medical professional, refused to offer any helpful advice over the phone and basically told her that she was welcome to find another primary care physician if she was dissatisfied with their service. To which I say - WHAT SERVICE?I was appalled to hear of how she was treated. She eventually was seen by Urgent Care who could not have been more helpful. Not only did Urgent Care see her immediately, they also called to follow up to see how she was feeling. For a walk-in patient. Appalling.\",-kfVnMHXVfo_f-4iqL_rtw\\n8/8/2018,5.0,\"Excellent medical practice. I\\'ve been seeing Dr. Godwin for several months and she is one of the best doctors I have encountered. She always takes the time to listen and discuss all of the available options. As a primary care physician she is top notch. The practice is well run and I have never had any issues with billing or the front office staff who are always friendly. The online patient portal lets the doctor send you notes on lab results explaining them to you (in addition to all of the numbers), which is much better than just getting a summary or numbers. The practice can get busy and they aren\\'t always taking new patients but I\\'ve never had an issue getting an appointment.\",-kfVnMHXVfo_f-4iqL_rtw\\n3/12/2018,1.0,\"This pains me to have to write a bad review but I have no other way to get a message across about my bad experience. Let me start by saying this: I had been going to Dr. Mcniff for around six years, usually just for my yearly physicals, but the last two years or so, I\\'ve been having issues with not feeling well, so I\\'ve gone a few extra times...getting no results.Cut ahead to the end of January 2018, when I went in for a physical before I move from NY. Still not feeling well (actually feeling worse), I had my exam and waited for test results. On February 14th, I sent a message on the patient portal because the results are usually posted for patients to see. Jeremy at the front desk sends a message right back to say that they were posted and that the doctor would contact me about my thyroid results. I look through my tests and see that the thyroid test was out of range, so I responded to him asking \"\"When?\"\". Absolutely no response. I called the next day and get told that he will call me. No phone call. I called again a day or two later. No phone call. 15 days later, I sent another message: \"\"15 days and counting...am I ever going to hear from Dr. Mcniff?\"\" No response.Today it is 4 days shy of a month and STILL no call. Wtf?? I called earlier today and was told once again that she will give him the message. I told her what is going on and that he never called me. I also told her that if they send me any bill (though I am pretty sure it\\'s all paid up), that I will withhold any payment until I get a call. She says that she will let him know. No call today. Seriously...I left my old doctor (whom used to work in the same practice as Dr. Mcniff) because he never told me the results of the asthma test that he sent me to take and then told me five months later when I was in his office that I tested moderate for asthma. What the hell is wrong with these doctors?? Don\\'t they care about treating patients? Or is this just a New York thing where there are so many people that doctors just don\\'t give a shit anymore?I took myself to City MD to go get a full thyroid panel.

My wife called Dr. Todd McNiff while dealing with serious flu symptoms. \"\"Dr Todd\"\" is her primary care physician and one would assume he would be concerned for an ill patient. My wife has had a difficult history with asthma as well as numerous bouts of pneumonia. This was way beyond a case of the sniffles. His team was completely dismissive of her problems and told her she would not be able to see the doctor for two weeks. Ok - fine. Appointments may be difficult to schedule, I get that. What was more disconcerting was the fact that they declined to offer to refer her to another doctor or medical professional, refused to offer any helpful advice over the phone and basically told her that she was welcome to find another primary care physician if she was dissatisfied with their service. To which I say - WHAT SERVICE?I was appalled to hear of how she was treated. She eventually was seen by Urgent Care who could not have been more helpful. Not only did Urgent Care see her immediately, they also called to follow up to see how she was feeling. For a walk-in patient. Appalling.\",-kfVnMHXVfo_f-4iqL_rtw\\n8/8/2018,5.0,\"Excellent medical practice. I\\'ve been seeing Dr. Godwin for several months and she is one of the best doctors I have encountered. She always takes the time to listen and discuss all of the available options. As a primary care physician she is top notch. The practice is well run and I have never had any issues with billing or the front office staff who are always friendly. The online patient portal lets the doctor send you notes on lab results explaining them to you (in addition to all of the numbers), which is much better than just getting a summary or numbers. The practice can get busy and they aren\\'t always taking new patients but I\\'ve never had an issue getting an appointment.\",-kfVnMHXVfo_f-4iqL_rtw\\n3/12/2018,1.0,\"This pains me to have to write a bad review but I have no other way to get a message across about my bad experience. Let me start by saying this: I had been going to Dr. Mcniff for around six years, usually just for my yearly physicals, but the last two years or so, I\\'ve been having issues with not feeling well, so I\\'ve gone a few extra times...getting no results.Cut ahead to the end of January 2018, when I went in for a physical before I move from NY. Still not feeling well (actually feeling worse), I had my exam and waited for test results. On February 14th, I sent a message on the patient portal because the results are usually posted for patients to see. Jeremy at the front desk sends a message right back to say that they were posted and that the doctor would contact me about my thyroid results. I look through my tests and see that the thyroid test was out of range, so I responded to him asking \"\"When?\"\". Absolutely no response. I called the next day and get told that he will call me. No phone call. I called again a day or two later. No phone call. 15 days later, I sent another message: \"\"15 days and counting...am I ever going to hear from Dr. Mcniff?\"\" No response.Today it is 4 days shy of a month and STILL no call. Wtf?? I called earlier today and was told once again that she will give him the message. I told her what is going on and that he never called me. I also told her that if they send me any bill (though I am pretty sure it\\'s all paid up), that I will withhold any payment until I get a call. She says that she will let him know. No call today. Seriously...I left my old doctor (whom used to work in the same practice as Dr. Mcniff) because he never told me the results of the asthma test that he sent me to take and then told me five months later when I was in his office that I tested moderate for asthma. What the hell is wrong with these doctors?? Don\\'t they care about treating patients? Or is this just a New York thing where there are so many people that doctors just don\\'t give a shit anymore?I took myself to City MD to go get a full thyroid panel. Thanks for nothing, Dr. Mcniff.\",-kfVnMHXVfo_f-4iqL_rtw\\n1/24/2019,5.0,\"I have been seeing Dr. Godwin Gorga for over 5 years now. I have to say that she is the best doctor I have ever had.

I have had Dr. McNiff as my primary care physician for couple years, and I can attest that he is the best doctor I have ever had.I have lived in other countries as well, and many doctors in New York have a tendency to overprescribe and throw unnecessary treatments at you. Not Dr. McNiff. He would not prescribe you anything more or less than what you need. He is one of the rare doctors where he consistently makes you feel like he has your interests in mind over money.

Thanks, Doc!\",-kfVnMHXVfo_f-4iqL_rtw\\n1/6/2017,2.0,\"Mohawk Medical is certainly a nice little office and Dr. McNiff and his staff are incredibly kind but I\\'ve just had a string of interactions that left me with a bad taste in my mouth wanting something better. Last time I was there I asked Dr. McNiff if he knew my blood type and he didn\\'t as it wasn\\'t in my chart. I have no real reason to know my blood type but my wife and family know theirs and I\\'ve always been curious about mine was so I wanted to know. Since I was there for blood work for something else I asked if he could have the test taken so I could find out mine. He reminded me there was no legit reason I would need to know my blood type but I just reminded him I still wanted to know so he said ok. Neither results were urgent so I completely forgot about them until months later I remembered I had that test and neither Dr. McNiff nor his office contacted me about the results. When I finally got the results I noticed nothing about my blood type. When I asked about this the doctor told me he never ordered the test because there wasn\\'t any reason for me to know it. I felt like I was in a Twilight Zone episode. He said if I wanted to make an appointment to come back in he\\'d order the test. Another appointment and bill for something I had already asked for previously? No thank you. Another thing is that I was under the impression that I could email Dr. McNiff with questions or concerns, when I first started going here years ago I remember sending him an email once and getting a quick response but this past year I sent an email that went unanswered for weeks. A follow up email was answered with an apology but when I responded to that email with another question, it too was never answered. Mohawk Village Medical\\'s website has a link to a patient portal so I thought that would be a better way to electronically communicate with them but after signing up for it I noticed they disabled the messaging feature of the portal. Ok so they aren\\'t good with any type of electronic communication. It\\'s certainly unfortunately in this day and age and for my lifestyle but it\\'s not unheard of. So I had time sensitive question that went unanswered in email so ended up calling the office. The receptionist was nice but unhelpful in answering my question that was for the doctor. I told the receptionist that I had emailed the Dr. and if he could tell him to check his email and get back to me as soon as possible by either phone or email. I was told he would pass that message on. Well I never got an email response or phone call back, it\\'s now weeks later so I\\'m here on Yelp updating my original review for the practice and seeing if there\\'s a better reviewed doctor/practice worth considering.\",-kfVnMHXVfo_f-4iqL_rtw\\n1/20/2017,1.0,\"I went for an annual check-up.

The office is like a 2 big bedroom apartment. McNiff has one, and Godwin-Gorga has one. The room is like an office and medical examination room in one - which is kinda weird. The office doesn\\'t feel \"\"clean\"\". One star is the delivery of test results - all in email and sign into an account. like the convenience.So - what\\'s the bad part is the changing of clothes. Usually they put you in a room to change and put the cover on, then the doctor comes in. But in McNiff\\'s office, he told me to take off my clothes behind those medical room dividers (which is IN his office and kind of short and skinny) I TOTALLY did NOT feel comfortable doing that, with no \"\"background noise\"\" to mask the clothes off sounds, it\\'s quite embarrassing. Not sure if the lighting casted a shadow of me \"\"stripping\"\" behind the curtains. But I definitely felt very UNEASY. Asked my other friends, they all thought it was weird too, not just me. I felt borderline humiliated changing my clothes like this...Also - after all those tests are done, i had to dispute the bill chargings with the receptionist.

We are also extremely understanding and reasonable people, so we get how hard he works (it\\'s plain to see), how much he cares about people, and how occasionally, a couple of patients may exploit or misunderstand that due to unrealistic or inappropriate expectations. With all that being said, if you\\'re a new or potential patient of Dr. McNiff or Dr. Godwin, expect a different experience than you\\'ve had previously. Both doctors will talk to you like you are a human being. They will not blindly prescribe you medications and if they advise lab tests, it is because they have a reasonable, educated concern or need to rule things out. Their staff, while often extremely busy, are helpful and kind, even via email.Dr. McNiff always has been and still is the type of person who advocates for his patients.

First of all, they treat you like an actual person here- Dr. McNiff really takes the time to explain things to me, patiently hear me out on my (mildly hypochondriacal) concerns, and get to know me. That\\'s even true for front desk staff, who remember my name and greet me the minute I walk in the door. I have been basically rushed out the door at other places, or have felt sort of dismissed, but have never felt that here. They\\'ve also been super accommodating of my busy schedule, squeezing me in for a short visit when I had strep throat or needed a TB test for work. The office manager, Ethan, is super friendly and always chats with me in the waiting room.It\\'s clear that they really care about the patients, even down to small details like having free umbrellas by the door in case it\\'s raining! I highly recommend this practice to anyone in need of a GP.

First time patient, and he took the time to hear my questions, and was very understanding of my current financial situation (don\\'t have insurance but do get a small health stipend each month from my job). He assured me that barring some extreme situation, he and his office would be willing to work with me going forward to not break the bank for regular medical visits and services. Very cool. Great bedside manner, and you could tell he genuinely cares about doing right by his patients.Just called him again today concerning what could be a small break or nasty sprain in my ankle (muay thai ain\\'t no joke!) and he assured me, after asking some questions about the injury, that it would likely simply be a matter of time for it to heal and that no special care was required. No need to come in to see him just to hear that. Saved me a lot of time and money. Again, testament to the fact that good doctoring, not profiting, is the primary goal of Mohawk Medical. Great support staff too - always friendly and able to answer questions, or get me in touch with the doc if need be. They also have an online health platform to keep all your info organized and easy to access. All in all, highly recommended.

The receptionist offered to reschedule my appointment for *today*. Alleged reason for the cancellation was the doctor now simply planned not to be in the office from Wednesday to Friday of this week -- forcing his receptionist to call all scheduled patients from Wed-Fri to cancel. The same reason was given for last week\\'s cancellation: the doctor simply planned not to come in. If your schedule happened to get messed up as a result of this doctor\\'s whim, c\\'est la vie.Completely unprofessional. One cancellation in as many weeks happens. Two cancellations in consecutive weeks without any reason other than \"\"not coming in\"\" is inconsiderate, arrogant, and the hallmark of someone who runs a disorganized medical practice.

We were both a bit heated in the end and he just gave me \"\"I didn\\'t have time for this\"\" attitude and just hung up on me.\",-kfVnMHXVfo_f-4iqL_rtw\\n12/22/2015,1.0,DO NOT GO HERE....YOU WILL BE CHEATED TOO.Dr. Todd Mcniff needs to learn what tests he needs to order for his patients. I went to him for annual physical examination and he ordered a bunch of tests that were not covered and not required. I had no knowledge of this happening until i got bills from the lab saying I have to pay them else my credit score will be affected.I am being totally cheated as there was no need for Dr. Todd to requests those tests. His office had my insurance details and this is part of his job to know what to request the lab. Very unprofessional and poor attitude towards patients.,-kfVnMHXVfo_f-4iqL_rtw\\n5/23/2016,5.0,\"I have been seeing Dr Todd for a few weeks now, and I have nothing but good things to say about him!His office staff is very helpful and kind,and Dr Todd has been helping me with my foot for weeks and makes me feel very reassured that he is doing all that he can for me.I highly recommend him! He is a great DR.His office is clean and modern and located in a great area as well.\",-kfVnMHXVfo_f-4iqL_rtw\\n12/7/2016,5.0,\"Let\\'s be clear here: My husband and I are one of the original patients of Dr. McNiff before he ever moved to his newer location and started his own practice. We are also extremely understanding and reasonable people, so we get how hard he works (it\\'s plain to see), how much he cares about people, and how occasionally, a couple of patients may exploit or misunderstand that due to unrealistic or inappropriate expectations. With all that being said, if you\\'re a new or potential patient of Dr. McNiff or Dr. Godwin, expect a different experience than you\\'ve had previously. Both doctors will talk to you like you are a human being. They will not blindly prescribe you medications and if they advise lab tests, it is because they have a reasonable, educated concern or need to rule things out. Their staff, while often extremely busy, are helpful and kind, even via email.Dr. McNiff always has been and still is the type of person who advocates for his patients. He\\'s that rare doctor who does what he does because he truly cares. My husband and I have endless respect for him and his colleagues.\",-kfVnMHXVfo_f-4iqL_rtw\\n3/15/2016,5.0,\"I have been coming to Dr. McNiff basically since the practice opened a few years back, and have had nothing but amazing experiences here. First of all, they treat you like an actual person here- Dr. McNiff really takes the time to explain things to me, patiently hear me out on my (mildly hypochondriacal) concerns, and get to know me. That\\'s even true for front desk staff, who remember my name and greet me the minute I walk in the door. I have been basically rushed out the door at other places, or have felt sort of dismissed, but have never felt that here. They\\'ve also been super accommodating of my busy schedule, squeezing me in for a short visit when I had strep throat or needed a TB test for work. The office manager, Ethan, is super friendly and always chats with me in the waiting room.It\\'s clear that they really care about the patients, even down to small details like having free umbrellas by the door in case it\\'s raining! I highly recommend this practice to anyone in need of a GP. This place feels like it\\'s out of a bygone era, when doctors actually had relationships with patients instead of treating them like insurance claims.\",-kfVnMHXVfo_f-4iqL_rtw\\n9/23/2015,5.0,\"Five stars indeed, this practice most certainly deserves it.I saw Dr. McNiff for a standard check-up. First time patient, and he took the time to hear my questions, and was very understanding of my current financial situation (don\\'t have insurance but do get a small health stipend each month from my job). He assured me that barring some extreme situation, he and his office would be willing to work with me going forward to not break the bank for regular medical visits and services. Very cool. Great bedside manner, and you could tell he genuinely cares about doing right by his patients.Just called him again today concerning what could be a small break or nasty sprain in my ankle (muay thai ain\\'t no joke!) and he assured me, after asking some questions about the injury, that it would likely simply be a matter of time for it to heal and that no special care was required. No need to come in to see him just to hear that. Saved me a lot of time and money. Again, testament to the fact that good doctoring, not profiting, is the primary goal of Mohawk Medical. Great support staff too - always friendly and able to answer questions, or get me in touch with the doc if need be. They also have an online health platform to keep all your info organized and easy to access. All in all, highly recommended.

The receptionist offered to reschedule my appointment for *today*. Alleged reason for the cancellation was the doctor now simply planned not to be in the office from Wednesday to Friday of this week -- forcing his receptionist to call all scheduled patients from Wed-Fri to cancel. The same reason was given for last week\\'s cancellation: the doctor simply planned not to come in. If your schedule happened to get messed up as a result of this doctor\\'s whim, c\\'est la vie.Completely unprofessional. One cancellation in as many weeks happens. Two cancellations in consecutive weeks without any reason other than \"\"not coming in\"\" is inconsiderate, arrogant, and the hallmark of someone who runs a disorganized medical practice.

I have been going to them for years and can\\'t imagine seeing anyone else. They take the time to explain why they prescribe or diagnose something so that I understand exactly what\\'s happening in my body, without talking to me as though I\\'m a child. I suppose what I appreciate most from them is that they are incredibly respectful of me and my medical needs, without judgment of my lifestyle. For example, I\\'m a smoker, and doctors I have seen in the past have chided me for it or lectured me about it, but the doctors here didn\\'t judge or scold, but instead mentioned that if I make the decision to quit, they can help. In addition to the doctors, the office staff is also phenomenal. They are fun and attentive and make going to the doctor much more enjoyable than it should be. I changed insurance companies recently and my new insurance didn\\'t cover some of my prescriptions, so I called the office and Ethan took the time to find out what I could take that would be covered and then called in the prescriptions to my pharmacy for me without hesitation. I can\\'t imagine getting better care anywhere else, and I have referred many of my friends here, as well.And while this doesn\\'t affect the level of care I receive, it is worth noting that they play great music in the office.\",-kfVnMHXVfo_f-4iqL_rtw\\n1/16/2019,5.0,\"Compassionate, confident and supportive.

As far as I know, you have to physically examine the body too. At the end he didnt really explain my diagnosis, he just gave me a printed results sheet and sent me on my merry way. This doctor needs to remind himself that not every person knows how to read a patient results page. And he never called me back when I had follow-up questions about my results. Not coming again.

He then either lied in his recounting of our original meeting, or he was not listening originally because I couldn\\'t have been clearer about the urgency of the situation given my recent move. I would have found someone else immediately if he hadn\\'t agreed to treat me in the first place. Otherwise, I did find the secretary staff to be very friendly.

Dr. Alleva could be awesome but I wouldn\\'t know. His staff was super nice. I just find it deeply ironic that a doctor who lists social justice and ending poverty as his interests doesn\\'t take any public insurance (Medicaid plans). As a lifelong resident of Williamsburg, and as a member of the working poor, I was very excited about this practice, but utterly disappointed to have taken a day off from work, waited for my appointment, only to be sent away because I can\\'t afford a private insurance plan. I wish this was a good neighborhood practice but this is more hipster rich folk gentrification nonsense. You don\\'t believe in social justice if you\\'re a doctor who won\\'t see poor patients.

He\\'s a local Brooklyn (literally from across the street). The guy knows what he\\'s doing and has a wealth of experience and knowledge (that he happily imparts) that makes him unique. So he tells a few jokes??He also remembered my name, gave me great advice, and genuinely seemed to care.Personally, that\\'s what I want in a doctor.\",FcayVsTKLVr8zXXJOYrywg\\n8/18/2015,1.0,\"I was going to overlook my experience at this office as a fluke one time thing. The office was close, within my healthcare network, and by all means if I\\'ve caught anything from this city its a case of thick sick.While I was spared the \"\"aspirin between the legs\"\" birth control comment which so frequently seems to have popped up in his other patients... I did get a slew of other really offensive off-color remarks. After asking me \"\"If I had a girlfriend?\"\" I (an out gay man living in Williamsburg in a committed relationship) corrected him \"\"boyfriend\"\" and his tone went from concerned to scolding. I was quickly reminded how \"\"risky and disturbing my life choices are\"\" I carefully explained to him that my sexual preference put me at no higher risk than anyone else as long as the same necessary preventative safety measures used. All this because I came in for a physical. He poked and prodded me for what felt like only long enough to satisfy my request and not a second of care longer. After sifting through a filthy trash heap of an office he wrote my standard blood work order and sent me to the lab. you think its over don\\'t you....I go to the lab, the codes he gave them were inaccurate and vague. This caused them to have to call the office (to no answer during typical business hours) and eventually run what they thought he meant by what he wrote.A few weeks pass and I get the bill, the codes for insurance were a mess as expected, I was charged over 100 dollars when the whole mortifying experience was promised to be free. I called the office to get the woman at the desk who told me to drop off a copy of the bill to see what she can do (I optimistically ask if i can email it to her, she says that she \"\"has no printer ink\"\"). *SIGH*Long story short, this was one of the worst medical experiences I\\'ve encountered. Inappropriate, disorganized, and ended up costing me nothing but time, money and grief. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.\",FcayVsTKLVr8zXXJOYrywg\\n10/26/2016,2.0,\"First of all there\\'s no way that Barricelli\\'s office will ever read this, because there\\'s a single computer in the office that might not even have Internet, and the receptionist spends most of her time rifling through stacks of dog-eared papers trying to find your record. She doesn\\'t even have time to submit referrals in a timely fashion, much less browse Yelp. So even if this isn\\'t read by the office, let it be a warning to you. If you have medicaid like me, you should know before you start that Barricelli is part of a physician\\'s network called HealthCare Partners that is an utter nightmare to work with. Extremely limited specialist selection, intentionally confusing referral process, bad customer service, and the list goes on. When I reflect on the amount of time and emotional energy I\\'ve expended on them, it sends me to a very dark place. What\\'s more is that neither the doctor nor the receptionist explained to me their byzantine referral process, leading me to schedule appointments the wrong way and (as of now) landing me with a few thousand dollars of medical bills. And when they have explained it (piecemeal, over the course of countless visits and phonecalls) it\\'s been occasionally contradictory with either what my insurance or a specialist\\'s office says. So for the love of God, just make sure that you get someone who actually understands the system to hold your hand through the entire process.Also prepare for your doctor\\'s visit to be composed of about 5 minutes of diagnosing your problem (and if you\\'re coming in multiple times, be prepared to re-explain everything as he probably won\\'t remember), and then anywhere from 5-20 minutes of a lecture about any of the following: drugs, sex, piety, respect, life, or love. My experience has been, that if there\\'s any way that your health problems can be related to your non-pious lifestyle, he will focus on that. For an extra old-fashioned touch, if you call during the first 30mins or so of office hours you will probably reach his wife instead and have a frantic and confused conversation with her. Took me a while to figure out that he didn\\'t have two receptionists, one of whom knew nothing at all about healthcare. Honestly, all of this old-fashioned stuff would be really quaint and kinda cute if we lived in a Norman Rockwell painting. But given that your well-being and sanity are on the line here, if you need anything beyond just a simple doctor\\'s visit and checkup, I would look elsewhere.\",FcayVsTKLVr8zXXJOYrywg\\n7/24/2016,5.0,\"These reviewers who gives this Dr. a bad review needs to shut up and get a life.

He started out with lectures about heart disease, diabetes, blood pressure. Basic suggestions about health. When he asked me questions about myself, there seemed to be no thorough analysis and his suggestions seemed completely unrelated to my reasons for being thereIt does look like the office hasn\\'t been cleaned or organized in fifty years. But I can look past that. What did bother me was the baby aspirin/abstinence comment and feeling like we were just going through the motions without actually analyzing my health.It was a general checkup and consisted of a couple comments that I did not find particularly useful, height and weight, blood pressure and a stethoscope.

It is not clean or pleasant - I took a photo which I will try and post here.Secondly, dr. Barricelli is strong on Catholicism and, on asking about my method of contraception, he advised me to come off the pill as the \"\"effects on your ovaries and uterus were unknown in the long run\"\", he then advised me to put two junior aspirin tablets between my legs instead. I understood that this was a joke, I am a 32 year old woman and I know how to prevent pregnancy but I am pretty concerned about the dr. advising a 19 year old girl without experience to do the same, even as a joke. I doubt he\\'d be prepared to refer for a termination if she got pregnant by coming off the pill and putting aspirin between her legs. This is not OK, seriously.He is an old guy, and pretty stuck in his methods. He gave me a diabetes and heart disease lecture and then that cranky contraception advice. As far as the medical complaint I went to see him for, he advised over the counter medicine and some lab work - If you know what you need and just want a prescription then maybe he\\'s an OK doctor to see, but if you are concerned about your health and need advice, steer well clear.\",FcayVsTKLVr8zXXJOYrywg\\n5/29/2012,3.0,\"I give this man 5 stars on friendliness and general well-being knowledge, but there were a couple things that threw me off to the point of not wanting to go back.I went in for a weird throat thing I had going on.

Still at 5 stars.Then the safe sex lecture came in and he told me to put two bayer aspirin between my knees and hold it there for some minutes as an alternative birth control. That, right there, is when I lost a lot of faith in this man as a doctor.He did seem to have that catholic-vibe to him, which I didn\\'t mind despite that I\\'m not religious. Although we did agree on some things such as not needing medicine and birth control pills because of health concerns. I have a holistic approach to my health, but I don\\'t really go for the aspirin-between-the-knees type of stuff. That freaked me out a little.

One of the nicest, most attentive doctors I\\'ve ever had the pleasure of visiting.

He\\'s a local Brooklyn (literally from across the street). The guy knows what he\\'s doing and has a wealth of experience and knowledge (that he happily imparts) that makes him unique. So he tells a few jokes??He also remembered my name, gave me great advice, and genuinely seemed to care.Personally, that\\'s what I want in a doctor.\",FcayVsTKLVr8zXXJOYrywg\\n8/18/2015,1.0,\"I was going to overlook my experience at this office as a fluke one time thing. The office was close, within my healthcare network, and by all means if I\\'ve caught anything from this city its a case of thick sick.While I was spared the \"\"aspirin between the legs\"\" birth control comment which so frequently seems to have popped up in his other patients... I did get a slew of other really offensive off-color remarks. After asking me \"\"If I had a girlfriend?\"\" I (an out gay man living in Williamsburg in a committed relationship) corrected him \"\"boyfriend\"\" and his tone went from concerned to scolding. I was quickly reminded how \"\"risky and disturbing my life choices are\"\" I carefully explained to him that my sexual preference put me at no higher risk than anyone else as long as the same necessary preventative safety measures used. All this because I came in for a physical. He poked and prodded me for what felt like only long enough to satisfy my request and not a second of care longer. After sifting through a filthy trash heap of an office he wrote my standard blood work order and sent me to the lab. you think its over don\\'t you....I go to the lab, the codes he gave them were inaccurate and vague. This caused them to have to call the office (to no answer during typical business hours) and eventually run what they thought he meant by what he wrote.A few weeks pass and I get the bill, the codes for insurance were a mess as expected, I was charged over 100 dollars when the whole mortifying experience was promised to be free. I called the office to get the woman at the desk who told me to drop off a copy of the bill to see what she can do (I optimistically ask if i can email it to her, she says that she \"\"has no printer ink\"\"). *SIGH*Long story short, this was one of the worst medical experiences I\\'ve encountered. Inappropriate, disorganized, and ended up costing me nothing but time, money and grief. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.\",FcayVsTKLVr8zXXJOYrywg\\n10/26/2016,2.0,\"First of all there\\'s no way that Barricelli\\'s office will ever read this, because there\\'s a single computer in the office that might not even have Internet, and the receptionist spends most of her time rifling through stacks of dog-eared papers trying to find your record. She doesn\\'t even have time to submit referrals in a timely fashion, much less browse Yelp. So even if this isn\\'t read by the office, let it be a warning to you. If you have medicaid like me, you should know before you start that Barricelli is part of a physician\\'s network called HealthCare Partners that is an utter nightmare to work with. Extremely limited specialist selection, intentionally confusing referral process, bad customer service, and the list goes on. When I reflect on the amount of time and emotional energy I\\'ve expended on them, it sends me to a very dark place. What\\'s more is that neither the doctor nor the receptionist explained to me their byzantine referral process, leading me to schedule appointments the wrong way and (as of now) landing me with a few thousand dollars of medical bills. And when they have explained it (piecemeal, over the course of countless visits and phonecalls) it\\'s been occasionally contradictory with either what my insurance or a specialist\\'s office says. So for the love of God, just make sure that you get someone who actually understands the system to hold your hand through the entire process.Also prepare for your doctor\\'s visit to be composed of about 5 minutes of diagnosing your problem (and if you\\'re coming in multiple times, be prepared to re-explain everything as he probably won\\'t remember), and then anywhere from 5-20 minutes of a lecture about any of the following: drugs, sex, piety, respect, life, or love. My experience has been, that if there\\'s any way that your health problems can be related to your non-pious lifestyle, he will focus on that. For an extra old-fashioned touch, if you call during the first 30mins or so of office hours you will probably reach his wife instead and have a frantic and confused conversation with her. Took me a while to figure out that he didn\\'t have two receptionists, one of whom knew nothing at all about healthcare. Honestly, all of this old-fashioned stuff would be really quaint and kinda cute if we lived in a Norman Rockwell painting. But given that your well-being and sanity are on the line here, if you need anything beyond just a simple doctor\\'s visit and checkup, I would look elsewhere.\",FcayVsTKLVr8zXXJOYrywg\\n7/24/2016,5.0,\"These reviewers who gives this Dr. a bad review needs to shut up and get a life. You see, people like myself and Dr. Baricelli were born and raised here in Brooklyn. We joke. Now you weird softees come into Brooklyn praising it so much, and are the first to call 311 or complain about a joke the old timer Doc made. His office is full of papers. So what. THE GUY IS A CLSSIC. He probably doesn\\'t know what a flash drive is. People like him are fading. People like him are what made the glorified Brooklyn that you whiners complain about. Grow up. As a matter of fact, take that aspirin he told u to put between ur legs, and shove it.\",FcayVsTKLVr8zXXJOYrywg\\n3/16/2015,1.0,\"The doctor did jokingly suggest to put two baby aspirin in between my legs and hold them there as a form of birth control (keeping legs closed, abstinence). An unappreciated and ineffective suggestion. He was a very sweet/nice man and I won\\'t take that away from him. Definitely seemed to have a pleasant demeanor. He started out with lectures about heart disease, diabetes, blood pressure. Basic suggestions about health. When he asked me questions about myself, there seemed to be no thorough analysis and his suggestions seemed completely unrelated to my reasons for being thereIt does look like the office hasn\\'t been cleaned or organized in fifty years. But I can look past that. What did bother me was the baby aspirin/abstinence comment and feeling like we were just going through the motions without actually analyzing my health.It was a general checkup and consisted of a couple comments that I did not find particularly useful, height and weight, blood pressure and a stethoscope. I really want to stress that he was nice, though.\",FcayVsTKLVr8zXXJOYrywg\\n8/3/2016,5.0,\"Dr. Barricelli, despite being almost 4 times my age, appears to be one of the most knowledgeable medical practitioners I\\'ve ever met. A sharp, astounding mind is coupled with compassionate, grandfatherly bedside manner(complete with an outdated sense of humor to which only the most caricatured Oberlinian would object) to produce the sensation of genuine care backed up by diligent attention, a deep knowledge base, and a long lifetime of experience.

Anything other then that type of scenario don\\'t go here. If you are a hypochondriac definitely don\\'t go here.

It is not clean or pleasant - I took a photo which I will try and post here.Secondly, dr. Barricelli is strong on Catholicism and, on asking about my method of contraception, he advised me to come off the pill as the \"\"effects on your ovaries and uterus were unknown in the long run\"\", he then advised me to put two junior aspirin tablets between my legs instead. I understood that this was a joke, I am a 32 year old woman and I know how to prevent pregnancy but I am pretty concerned about the dr. advising a 19 year old girl without experience to do the same, even as a joke. I doubt he\\'d be prepared to refer for a termination if she got pregnant by coming off the pill and putting aspirin between her legs. This is not OK, seriously.He is an old guy, and pretty stuck in his methods. He gave me a diabetes and heart disease lecture and then that cranky contraception advice. As far as the medical complaint I went to see him for, he advised over the counter medicine and some lab work - If you know what you need and just want a prescription then maybe he\\'s an OK doctor to see, but if you are concerned about your health and need advice, steer well clear.\",FcayVsTKLVr8zXXJOYrywg\\n5/29/2012,3.0,\"I give this man 5 stars on friendliness and general well-being knowledge, but there were a couple things that threw me off to the point of not wanting to go back.I went in for a weird throat thing I had going on. First 10 minutes, he starts with the lectures about diabetes, heart attacks, etc, which I could deal with because he was just trying to give his patient general knowledge. Still at 5 stars.Then the safe sex lecture came in and he told me to put two bayer aspirin between my knees and hold it there for some minutes as an alternative birth control. That, right there, is when I lost a lot of faith in this man as a doctor.He did seem to have that catholic-vibe to him, which I didn\\'t mind despite that I\\'m not religious. Although we did agree on some things such as not needing medicine and birth control pills because of health concerns. I have a holistic approach to my health, but I don\\'t really go for the aspirin-between-the-knees type of stuff. That freaked me out a little. Maybe, just maybe, he was joking because he did seem to spit out jokes now and again. Something about the way he delivered it though didn\\'t come off as if he was joking.I have mixed feelings. I may go back simply because he was nice and didn\\'t rush me out, but I think I could find a doctor more suited towards my type of approach.Otherwise, I think he is great for anyone needing to come in for the common cold, etc.\",FcayVsTKLVr8zXXJOYrywg\\n8/16/2016,1.0,\"Do not go to this Dr., while he is very sweet, I walked in to the messiest office I have ever seen and quite dirty.

When she called following up on payment for $32, for no services, she threatened me saying she was going to send to collections.

He never bothered to give me a technical term for what I had, \"\"messed up\"\" was fine. Tonsillitis, strep, whatever, all the same to me and he broke out a prescription for some antibiotics and directed me down the block to Saldo Drugs to get it filled.I\\'ve been back a couple times over the years for roughly the same yearly condition and for as unpleasant the reason the most pleasant of experiences.

Appeared complacent about my Asthma, (a new doctor has me take a breathing test every visit - something he never did once in years) and failed to carefully offer a reduction of my dossage of sleeping pill dependency. He simply, freaked out, told me, no more sleeping pills, put on his jacket and ran to another meeting. I asked what about my Asthma medicine -- he left me with over the counter pills and just dashed out. Clearly he had more important meetings to attend. In fairness he did follow up 3 days later. During myType II Diabetes debacle, I pleaded with him to check my sugars and he actually laughed, \"\"You don\\'t have Diabetes, you simply stopped drinking\"\" . Well, it turns out after begrudgingly performing the procedure he was alarmed that my sugars registered at an insane 740, and I was at risk of having a stroke. He hurriedly suggested a specialist. It scared the daylights out of him, because no primary doctor wants to explain to another doctor, how did you let the patient\\'s blood sugar get to danger levels? Even the specialist had concern, but he didn\\'t want to critique another doctor. I followed up with NYU specialist Terry F. Seltzer MD. and still continue to see him. My levels are now below 100.Since common sense dictated, that if the doctor made that kind of colossal mistake with my health once, he would compensate and I should receive extra special care in the future, so I foolishly didn\\'t change primary doctors. Alas, didn\\'t take long, another incident. All in an effort to make his office run smoothly, in out, call in medicine. Like a machine. As a severe asmatic, I went for treatment and to get new prescriptions. Dr. St. Claire gave me a rudimentary weight, ear eye checkup, and had me leave the clinic with no new medication. Incredibly, i left not breathing well. I grabbed a coke and took 3 Primatine tablets to protect that my lack of breathing didn\\'t worsen on the subway ride home.  He also prescribed increasing my dose of Advair 500/250, but that takes 5 days to work.Additionally, that same day he stopped my sleeping pills, after I had been on them for 7 years. Granted, I need to sleep without pills, so felt maybe he w was doing the right thing, however, i Googled only to find numerous documents stating that a doctor should reduce dosage and not simply cut the patient. or any other treatment. Well, to his credit, he did recommend an \"\"online course\"\" -- to reduce stress, - seriously.  What wa the point of having medical coverage, if i can go online. Why not reduce my sleeping pills to half a dosage and bring me down slowly like all medical docs say -- I hope he made it to that very important meeting. Yeah I\\'m pissed.

Ilona is amazing, and a huge part of the reason I\\'ve remained a patient here. She is very understanding, patient and warm. She really takes her time and cares about how her patients are feeling. Very grateful I\\'ve found Dr St Claire and Ilona!\",0703SBlNhLNJm5F3yef7pA\\n11/22/2015,5.0,\"I absolutely love going to see Dr. St. Claire, who in their right mind likes going to the doctor right? I do, when I get exceptional service, and the girls up front cracks me up and I always feel so much better when I leave compared to when I arrive. Today, however I\\'m a little sad because after reading the last review that was posted about Dr. St. Claire\\'s practice, it makes me wonder what people\\'s intentions are. As an establishes patient who knows the practice very well I feel the need to post my own review. I don\\'t do it very much but my nail technician asked me to write a review about her business when I went to see her last and I came up on this review by JF.After reading the review, I thought to myself, this is a little far fetched, the content is a little bit choreographed to me. I understand that everyone has their own experiences and are entitled to their own opinion, but if you love Dr. St. Claire so much and you respect his business, and you will always be a patient of his, don\\'t you think it would be a good idea to voice your opinion to the doctor at your \"\"appointment\"\". To put St. Claire Medical and that poor girl on blast like you did is just so wrong and can potentially cause some serious harm. To deliberately put some one down in an attempt to elevate another, how is that any different from what your review is about?The \"\"receptionist\"\" as you referred to her, is a person and she has a name which you never bothered to address her properly, since you are all about \"\"respect\"\". I\\'ve had encounters with the \"\"receptionist\"\", I\\'ve cancelled appointments just hours before I was scheduled to arrived and I\\'ve missed appointments, simply because I just couldn\\'t make them, which means I had to reschedule a few times. All of those times I have had encounters with the receptionist, she was never rude or disrespectful to me on any of those occasions, even though my schedule was crazy and could no go the times I was supposed to, I was less than pleasant to her those times because I just wanted my way and even though I said some things to her that I am not very proud of, she still kept her composure and was professional and respectful to me.I finally showed up to my next scheduled appointment and I walked through that door and I met the \"\"receptionist\"\" for the first time in person, she greeted me with a smile and she was very bright and pleasant and she was very kind even though I was less than pleasant to her a few times and I know she knew who I was because she greeted me by name. When I came out after meeting with Dr. St. Claire I had to stop at the desk because I needed a follow up appointment. Just as she began speaking the phone rang and she said excuse me and answered it and put the person on hold, and in a split second the phone rang again and she again said excuse me, answered the phone and place them on hold, but in the middle of me booking my appointment, the phone rang again and it was one of the previous callers that she had put on hold, and that person did not want to be put on hold. She whispered to me \"\"I\\'m very sorry, please give me one minute\"\", and I needed to go, but as I watch her facial expression changed, I know the person on the phone wasn\\'t being very polite.I felt sooo bad because I remembered my own phone call to her a few weeks earlier and how she must have felt with me going off on her like I did, when she was so polite and was trying to work with me and my very busy schedule. Luisa saw me there and asked if I needed help and I told her no because I wanted to speak with the \"\"receptionist\"\". I stood there and watched that poor girl apologize over and over, when she did nothing wrong, when she came off the phone and before she could say anything to me, I smiled at her and she jokingly asked if I\\'m laughing at her and I said no, I\\'m just admiring your patience, and I asked her her name because I did not know it even though her and I had spoken a few times over the phone.JF. Her name is Cheryl and she is a great receptionist and a great addition to Dr. St. Claire\\'s team, before I left the office, I apologized to her over and over for how I was with her a few weeks back and I made an excuse as to why I was cranky because I was ashamed of my behavior towards her. Cheryl, for everyone who is ever less than pleasant to you while doing your job, I apologize, and I hope both you and Dr. St. Claire finds this note comforting.\",0703SBlNhLNJm5F3yef7pA\\n6/28/2016,1.0,\"This office lied about billing, promised to sort things out, provided a refund because of improperly billed services, then billed me AGAIN.

As a brand new patient to him, we went over my medical history and I felt some judgment on his part based off of his facial expressions and tone. It was very awkward and I felt very uncomfortable. Never felt that he was an attentive doctor and feel he has an awkward sense of humor. My last visit I left with no solution to my problem and no accurate medical advice.

At the end of the day too difficult to schedule an appoitment.,0703SBlNhLNJm5F3yef7pA\\n1/4/2016,5.0,\"Dr. St Claire and his staff are the best of the best. I found them years ago after a friend referred me, and I can not say enough good things. Dr. St Claire is the most personable, funny, and caring doctor. He really makes you feel comfortable and takes the time to get to know you and always takes his time for his patients- like other reviews here have said, you can really tell that he cares about us and that\\'s very important when looking for the right Doctor, especially in NYC! Dr St Claire is a true gem in NYC and I\\'m so happy I found them. The whole staff treats you well and it\\'s just a very welcoming and nice environment there with more of a family feel. Unfortunately for me, Dr St Claire\\'s schedule fills up very quickly now (word must be getting around about how great he is), and I had to recently go to another doctor as I couldn\\'t get in to see Dr St Claire in time as he was really booked up- going to this other Doctor (who wasn\\'t even half as personable or nice as Dr St Claire- I didn\\'t like him much at all) made me realize even more how much I appreciate Dr St Claire and how lucky I am to have found such a wonderful medical practice. I will never be going back to that other doctors office again, there\\'s no one better than Dr St Claire and that last appointment elsewhere confirmed that- I will just need to start booking my appointments further in advance so that never has to happen again!\",0703SBlNhLNJm5F3yef7pA\\n11/13/2018,5.0,\"awesome, caring doctor who listens and is a great person - one of the better physicians I\\'ve ever encountered.\",0703SBlNhLNJm5F3yef7pA\\n3/13/2017,1.0,\"Dr. St. Claire mis-diagnosed my Type II Diabetes. Appeared complacent about my Asthma, (a new doctor has me take a breathing test every visit - something he never did once in years) and failed to carefully offer a reduction of my dossage of sleeping pill dependency. He simply, freaked out, told me, no more sleeping pills, put on his jacket and ran to another meeting. I asked what about my Asthma medicine -- he left me with over the counter pills and just dashed out. Clearly he had more important meetings to attend. In fairness he did follow up 3 days later. During myType II Diabetes debacle, I pleaded with him to check my sugars and he actually laughed, \"\"You don\\'t have Diabetes, you simply stopped drinking\"\" . Well, it turns out after begrudgingly performing the procedure he was alarmed that my sugars registered at an insane 740, and I was at risk of having a stroke. He hurriedly suggested a specialist. It scared the daylights out of him, because no primary doctor wants to explain to another doctor, how did you let the patient\\'s blood sugar get to danger levels? Even the specialist had concern, but he didn\\'t want to critique another doctor. I followed up with NYU specialist Terry F. Seltzer MD. and still continue to see him. My levels are now below 100.Since common sense dictated, that if the doctor made that kind of colossal mistake with my health once, he would compensate and I should receive extra special care in the future, so I foolishly didn\\'t change primary doctors. Alas, didn\\'t take long, another incident. All in an effort to make his office run smoothly, in out, call in medicine. Like a machine. As a severe asmatic, I went for treatment and to get new prescriptions. Dr. St. Claire gave me a rudimentary weight, ear eye checkup, and had me leave the clinic with no new medication. Incredibly, i left not breathing well. I grabbed a coke and took 3 Primatine tablets to protect that my lack of breathing didn\\'t worsen on the subway ride home.  He also prescribed increasing my dose of Advair 500/250, but that takes 5 days to work.Additionally, that same day he stopped my sleeping pills, after I had been on them for 7 years. Granted, I need to sleep without pills, so felt maybe he w was doing the right thing, however, i Googled only to find numerous documents stating that a doctor should reduce dosage and not simply cut the patient. or any other treatment. Well, to his credit, he did recommend an \"\"online course\"\" -- to reduce stress, - seriously.  What wa the point of having medical coverage, if i can go online. Why not reduce my sleeping pills to half a dosage and bring me down slowly like all medical docs say -- I hope he made it to that very important meeting. Yeah I\\'m pissed. When someone messes up once, don\\'t give them a 2nd time, especially with your health. All smiles and niceties at the office, collect your co-pay -- but incompetence rains supreme here. Find another doctor.\",0703SBlNhLNJm5F3yef7pA\\n12/12/2015,5.0,\"YES YES YES.After years of trying to find a good, caring, pleasant, easy-to-get-in-contact-with doctor in NYC--FINALLY! This man is awesome. When I first got there I was greeted by the kindest lady, and when I was called back Dr. St. Claire came out to get me, shook my hand and took me into his office where we chatted. He listened, payed attention and asked questions BEFORE the exam. It was really nice, felt like he cared and he wasn\\'t rushing.The nurse who took my blood and vitals was GREAT! [wish i remembered her name!!] She is also the one who called me with my lab results.I felt like they cared and I would recommend that practice to ANYONE! THANK YOU ST. CLAIR MEDICAL! Oh, I should also note, the first time I called there was a month wait--and I really wanted to get in, she said I could come in at 4PM that day [which I couldn\\'t swing with work] but that next Monday I called her again and asked to be put on the cancellation list--she called me back at 3PM that day and asked me to come Wednesday. AWESOME!\",0703SBlNhLNJm5F3yef7pA\\n4/17/2015,5.0,\"Dr. St. Clair has a quirky sense of humor and it took me a second to feel it out during my first appointment. After I understood his humor a bit, I felt as comfortable as I could possibly feel (while discussing personal things with someone you just met). He was very thorough and knowledgeable, quickly figuring out I had somehow pinched a nerve in my back. I very much appreciate how he was actually listening to what I was actually saying. I feel pretty in tune with and good at \"\"listening to my body\"\" so it\\'s nice to see a doctor who is good at listening to my observations and interpreting them properly. I feel completely confident in his diagnosis and about his doctorin\\' skills, in general.

I\\'m very squeamish around needles and other invasive procedures, but he is completely respectful and understanding of this, which makes me feel at ease. I no longer have an aversion to doctor\\'s visits and genuinely look forward to my physicals because I know they will be worthwhile and that I will have a positive experience. Dr. St. Claire\\'s staff is awesome too: friendly, helpful, follow up with me promptly concerning results of my blood work, messages to Dr. St. Claire, etc. My advice is to try and schedule appointments far in advance if you can.

Or, an on-site anger management therapist.

I say deliberately because she soon revealed that there were too many reports the doctor still had yet to read. But, logically and humanely speaking, is that a good reason to turn a patient away? What if it turned out to be a time-sensitive, life-threatening diagnosis?) If I am writing this review in this situation, you know it\\'s dire.

I met her for the first time today and she was extremely nice to me - we connected instantaneously. When my dad saw Dr. Fung, I joined him and Dr. Fung was amazing. She was patient with all of the questions I had and she showed genuine care and concern for my dad - which is what and how we want all of our doctors to be.

It\\'s great that she allow walk-ins but she allows too many to just sign in and leave.

A lot of people would sign in for their friend/family and they would come up whenever they\\'re free and go right in. The office should move the people whose name that have been called to the back of the list. But she doesn\\'t.

My daughter\\'s OB/GYN said I had to take the shot immediately so that I can hold my new born grandson due to arrive anytime in a week or two.I live in Jersey and crossing the George Washington Bridge on a Sunday afternoon to get to Chinatown took me more than TWO hours. Upon arrival at around 5:30PM I was patient #69 with patients waiting both inside and outside the office. Patient #48 was just called and I fully understood I had to wait being the last patient to register and a walk-in as well. Hardly had I sat down when Karen singled me out and said: \"\"You can\\'t leave this room and if you do, I won\\'t let you see the doctor.\"\" I thought this threat was very rude and inconsiderate to a 70 year old who had fought traffic for two hours to get to Chinatown and now had to sit still for another two hours not being allowed to leave the waiting room.  Anyway I told her I needed to go out to let my husband in the car know about the anticipated wait.  During the wait from 5:30pm to 7:35pm, I noticed her being very rude, haughty and even yelling at patients over the phone.I have long observed this person\\'s despicable personality the last three years as Dr Fung\\'s patient, always fearing the time bomb would explode on me one day. So that day came at last. There were about 3 patients left after a 2-hour wait when one of the patients mentioned she had another person coming in to see Dr Fung also. To my surprise, Karen let this unregistered patient go ahead of me. Since Karen was so strict with me having to wait on line for over two hours, I was pretty upset that this unregistered patient could go ahead of me without waiting.  When I brought this up, Karen in an utmost unprofessional manner, shouted at me on top of her lungs: \"\"TELL DR FUNG TO FIRE ME, TELL DR FUNG TO FIRE ME.\"\" SHE BOLDLY REPEATED IT TWO TO THREE TIMES.  She understands very well where she stands and how much backup she has.  But the most unexpected bizarre behavior she exhibited was that she stepped out of the office a minute or two and came back sobbing with a middle-aged guy who yelled at me : \"\"WHAT DID YOU DO TO HER , WHAT DID YOU DO TO HER? YOU MADE HER CRY LIKE THIS.\"\" I told him I did not do anything to her and he should ask her what she had done to me.When I got to Dr Fung\\'s office I told her what had happened in the waiting room. I commented Karen must have some emotional issues that cause her to repeatedly demonstrate nasty behavior to her patients. However, Dr Fung didn\\'t seem to show much response to my comment.A busy office like Dr Fung\\'s probably doesn\\'t care losing patients as long as KAREN can handle the front desk and the patients in her own way. Patients with high blood pressure should NEVER visit this office because it only shoots up your reading. Even worse for me, I couldn\\'t get my Tdap vaccine that day. Karen understood what a Tdap was during our morning phone conversation but she didn\\'t advise me that Dr Fung\\'s office does not provide the Tdap vaccine unless I purchase it from nearby pharmacy and let her do the shot on me. Just imagine, Karen knows I live across the GW bridge in Jersey, having to drive all the way to Chinatown, wait for two hours in the office, let an unregistered patient go ahead of me and at the end to find out I couldn\\'t get the vaccine from Dr Fung.

What made it worse is that the office was packed and there were NO SEATS. How do you expect an elderly woman with bad legs to stand and wait THREE HOURS to see a doctor. When she finally saw Dr. Fung, the visit lasted TEN MINUTES. A THREE-HOUR WAIT FOR A TEN MINUTE VISIT!

I attribute the LOOONNG wait to that she\\'s just that awesome of a doctor. She takes her time with each patient and will never be rushing you out of the door.She\\'s really friendly and understanding and willing to listen to whatever you have to say. Can I say that she makes flu shots seem less painful? Haha, well she sure is fast in administering it which is assuring for a person afraid of needles (maybe me).

However if you speak to her in English she is a bit more pleasant (just a bit), wow is that how you treat people. I don\\'t find this acceptable and with the wait time it is ridiculously. How she likes to quote to you it is an hour wait but there is 20 people ahead of you. Does she not realize not everyone can sit there and wait 3-4 hours. \"\" can you wait I am busy doing something \"\" I am not sure how to describe her crass and very unprofessional is what comes to mind. How she likes to scream HIPPA at you but does she understand what HIPPA really is, I can already tell her the way you conduct conversations with patients is already a direct violation. Patients go there to see Dr. Fung because she is great but we are not there to let you take your frustrations out at. Just not acceptable. Like we are at mercy of her.

It is really hard to find a good doctor and I\\'m glad there is someone like Dr. Fung and who will take your insurance.The only downside is appointments get booked up quickly and though you can walk in, the wait can take up to 2 hours.

I say deliberately because she soon revealed that there were too many reports the doctor still had yet to read. But, logically and humanely speaking, is that a good reason to turn a patient away? What if it turned out to be a time-sensitive, life-threatening diagnosis?) If I am writing this review in this situation, you know it\\'s dire.

A lot of people would sign in for their friend/family and they would come up whenever they\\'re free and go right in. The office should move the people whose name that have been called to the back of the list. But she doesn\\'t.

My daughter\\'s OB/GYN said I had to take the shot immediately so that I can hold my new born grandson due to arrive anytime in a week or two.I live in Jersey and crossing the George Washington Bridge on a Sunday afternoon to get to Chinatown took me more than TWO hours. Upon arrival at around 5:30PM I was patient #69 with patients waiting both inside and outside the office. Patient #48 was just called and I fully understood I had to wait being the last patient to register and a walk-in as well. Hardly had I sat down when Karen singled me out and said: \"\"You can\\'t leave this room and if you do, I won\\'t let you see the doctor.\"\" I thought this threat was very rude and inconsiderate to a 70 year old who had fought traffic for two hours to get to Chinatown and now had to sit still for another two hours not being allowed to leave the waiting room.  Anyway I told her I needed to go out to let my husband in the car know about the anticipated wait.  During the wait from 5:30pm to 7:35pm, I noticed her being very rude, haughty and even yelling at patients over the phone.I have long observed this person\\'s despicable personality the last three years as Dr Fung\\'s patient, always fearing the time bomb would explode on me one day. So that day came at last. There were about 3 patients left after a 2-hour wait when one of the patients mentioned she had another person coming in to see Dr Fung also. To my surprise, Karen let this unregistered patient go ahead of me. Since Karen was so strict with me having to wait on line for over two hours, I was pretty upset that this unregistered patient could go ahead of me without waiting.  When I brought this up, Karen in an utmost unprofessional manner, shouted at me on top of her lungs: \"\"TELL DR FUNG TO FIRE ME, TELL DR FUNG TO FIRE ME.\"\" SHE BOLDLY REPEATED IT TWO TO THREE TIMES.  She understands very well where she stands and how much backup she has.  But the most unexpected bizarre behavior she exhibited was that she stepped out of the office a minute or two and came back sobbing with a middle-aged guy who yelled at me : \"\"WHAT DID YOU DO TO HER , WHAT DID YOU DO TO HER? YOU MADE HER CRY LIKE THIS.\"\" I told him I did not do anything to her and he should ask her what she had done to me.When I got to Dr Fung\\'s office I told her what had happened in the waiting room. I commented Karen must have some emotional issues that cause her to repeatedly demonstrate nasty behavior to her patients. However, Dr Fung didn\\'t seem to show much response to my comment.A busy office like Dr Fung\\'s probably doesn\\'t care losing patients as long as KAREN can handle the front desk and the patients in her own way. Patients with high blood pressure should NEVER visit this office because it only shoots up your reading. Even worse for me, I couldn\\'t get my Tdap vaccine that day. Karen understood what a Tdap was during our morning phone conversation but she didn\\'t advise me that Dr Fung\\'s office does not provide the Tdap vaccine unless I purchase it from nearby pharmacy and let her do the shot on me. Just imagine, Karen knows I live across the GW bridge in Jersey, having to drive all the way to Chinatown, wait for two hours in the office, let an unregistered patient go ahead of me and at the end to find out I couldn\\'t get the vaccine from Dr Fung.  Any humanity, morality or professionalism in this kind of medical office setting?KAREN IS TRULY DISGUSTING AND HEARTLESS! Or could it be she only favors certain types of patients.

But I\\'m getting to that stage of life where it\\'s time to settle down so I started my search for a long-term doctor. Quite a few of my coworkers seemed happy with Dr. Pentecostes as their PCP so I decided to give her a call. Part of the Weill-Cornell hospital group, Dr. Pentecostes\\' office is on the 11th floor. The building itself is somewhat dingy but the medical space itself is awash with light, clean lines, and a reassuring sterility. Checking in is a painlessly efficient process and the wait shouldn\\'t be too long, but there is complimentary guest wifi available to keep you entertained for any dallying stays. Dr. Pentecostes is one of the best listeners in the profession. She takes the time to hear you out regarding pain, problems, and medical history. She is also one of the only doctors I\\'ve met who is unwilling to throw drugs at a symptoms, preferring instead to try and uncover root issues. My appointments with her have never felt rushed, though she is as efficient as she is caring and honors punctual patients with her undivided time. During my first visit, the front desk failed to let me know that I should arrive 15 minutes earlier to take care of initial paperwork so I ended up having to forego my appointment time and waiting an additional forty minutes to get seen. When she heard about the miscommunication, Dr. Pentecostes was dismayed and promised she\\'d speak to the folks at the front desk. I thought nothing of it afterwards, but during my next visit about a month later, she asked me if it was a quicker check-in than last time. In fact, it had been (I don\\'t know if it could have been any faster - they were ushering me into the room while I was still handing over the copay), but I was pleasantly surprised that she so acutely remembered the specifics of my last visit.

Luckily I still had the confirmation voicemail from the day before. I played the voicemail from their own staff member confirming my appointment.When Dr. Suurna agreed to meet with me for a few minutes, she was deer in the headlights and I could tell she couldn\\'t remember me or what had happened in the first visit. She said, \"\"the pain is in the right side, correct?\"\" -- no, it was on the left. Visit was wasted since we had to start from square one so that she could remember what was going on. This was three weeks after my first visit. I\\'m a cool cucumber in unpleasant situations, so I silently showed my disappointment. I was pretty angry since I was missing work while the staff and Dr. Suurna was trying to figure out what had happened and what to do. She then said that I should come back for the CT scan, scheduling my THIRD visit to this office.When I was whisked away to the scheduling area to schedule for the CT scan, I gave my feedback to the scheduling staff and she insisted/defended that Dr. Suurna \"\"is a great doctor\"\". I said to her, \"\"She may be a great doctor, but she is apparently very unorganized and seemed disoriented.\"\" After my third visit, CT scan took place with a different person. The person who helped me with the CT scan said that Dr. Suurna would be the one giving me a follow up call with the CT scan results. I never received that call.\",IEFslgdjKvDizbDL_pq0uQ\\n6/20/2016,5.0,\"This is a satellite location. Main office for my Doc is on the upper east side.

Alas I have seen her once and will never need to revisit so no skin off my back.I know other reviewers say that Dr. Chang is mechanical and I so get where they are coming from. However, I chose to kind of inject some humanity into my appointment and knew that he had worked with the NY Yankees so we talked about that and he helped me determine that a cooking injury was healing as it should which was a huge relief.And most recently I came to this practice to see Dr. Wu who I love. Her assistant is really nice and funny (her name is Patricia I think?) and Dr. Wu was so calm and clear about everything. And what I loved was she sent me a message via Weill Cornell Connect to tell me my results came back normal which many doctors would not do.

Dr. Asaf was very kind and friendly. I really feel like he took his time to actually get to know me. In no way shape or form did I feel rushed. I really felt as though he cared about getting to know me and any questions I had. I would highly recommend him. I do not remember the nurse that took my blood but she was amazing.

He seems to know his stuff. But I thought that his approach was mechanical, and that he was uninterested in me and also a bit lackadaisical at follow-up. I received test results but had to prompt him to advise me as to whether or not they were OK.But my main problem is their insurance billing, which is the very worst that I\\'ve encountered and which caused me to drop them entirely. Every time I visited one of their doctors - every time! - I was socked by charges not covered by insurance. At first I thought it was the insurance company. Natural to blame em, right? But it wasn\\'t. I haven\\'t had problems with any other doctor, only Weill-Cornell.My first visit to Dr. Chang was an annual physical. Should have been no charges whatsoever. Instead I was socked with unanticipated lab charges that make no sense whatsoever. One, about $8, was for drawing blood. Huh? Drawing blood? I also was socked with $110 in charges for routine blood tests. So that\\'s $120 for a visit that should have cost nothing.Then I was referred to Dr. Andrea Wang for a hearing issue. Should have cost me $35 in copay and not a penny more. But since W-C classed a routine ear wax removal as \"\"surgery,\"\" I was charged another $40. But the last straw was that I was referred to a lady down the hall for a hearing test. What I wasn\\'t told was that it was NOT ON THE NETWORK. $295. Total bill $335, for a visit that should have cost me $35.Bottom line: Goodbye Weill-Cornell. It hasn\\'t been nice knowing you.\",IEFslgdjKvDizbDL_pq0uQ\\n5/21/2015,1.0,\"Buyer (and patient) beware. Let me preface that I have a high deductible on my health insurance so before I see a doctor, I call in advance to understand my costs. My family doctor recommended I see an Ears Nose and Throat doctor because I have a hard lump below my jawline. When I called Weill Cornell on Broadway, I told the person who answered that I need to be careful with costs so please let me know what an office visit would be. They said for Dr Banuchi, excluding any additional diagnostic tests, a doctor visit, should run around $225. With that in mind, I saw Dr Banuchi. No extra tests were taken. Fast forward a few weeks later my insurance company tells me Dr Banuchi charged $525. I assume the contracted rate between Aetna and Dr Banuchi is $400, which is what I\\'m now being charged for.So I called Weill Cornell and explained all of the above and they were dismissive and said that\\'s the price and that\\'s it. Both their management and the doctor said there\\'s nothing I can do. They didn\\'t consider that one of their staff previously quoted me less than half of what dr Banuchi charged for a simple office visit.I\\'m writing this review to help others who need to be careful and on budget especially with high deductibles.\",IEFslgdjKvDizbDL_pq0uQ\\n1/20/2016,5.0,This medical clinic is convenient to upper westsiders and the staff is certainly professional.

The Broadway location of Weill is internal medicine; I went there for the gynecologist but they also have other non-GYN internal specialists. The building is incredibly close to the 1 train and easy to access. The doctors\\' offices are across a few floors, so check the sign on the wall before you head into the elevator. Gynecology is on the second floor, and I went to Dr. Yelena Havryliuk. Right now I\\'m rolling with \"\"Doctor Yelena\"\", which I hope she doesn\\'t mind. Even though I\\'ve got an intimidating Czech last name myself I\\'m still having a little trouble pronouncing her last name!The office is clean and bright with a very large waiting room. An immediate difference from the Weill Cornell location around the block where my primary care is, which is located basically in a basement. My wait was short and I had almost no paperwork to fill out since I was already in the system. The nurse was dry and friendly, she even got me to have some blood tests done (I\\'m notoriously bad with giving blood), so kudos to her for being quick and distracting enough that I didn\\'t pass out or run out of the office!Dr. Havryliuk is a younger woman, has a great demeanor, and makes you feel comfortable.

First, I will say that I have been seeing her for many years and she has gotten noticeably more friendly and helpful over the years, she really seems to care about me and my health. When I first started seeing her she was a little more distant but that has changed dramatically. She has become more friendly, she spends more time with me in appointments, and is very patient with me, never rushing out to the next appointment.I have had some issues with a recent pregnancy and she has been extremely helpful - calling me back as soon as I call her, reaching out of her own accord to check on me, being patient and answering all my questions, making time for me in her busy schedule for multiple emergency appointments, etc. She has been immensely accommodating. Compared to other doctors I have dealt with recently, she is a treat.As for the people who say there was not enough hand holding and question answering, etc. - I don\\'t disagree that Dr. Weinstein is not the coddling type, but it\\'s not necessarily a negative. I have friends who have hours of questions for their OBGYN at every appointment, are scared of everything, have read every article there is about pregnancies going awry, are convinced things are wrong with them, and need someone to calm them down. If that\\'s you, Dr. Weinstein might not be the best fit (though again, I think she has changed very much as a doctor over the years and is very compassionate). I suspect that the people writing negative reviews probably fall more in that camp than my camp, of pregnant women who are pretty calm, have few questions, are not nervous and don\\'t need a lot of hand holding. That\\'s not to say I haven\\'t had a million questions over the years, as well as some serious issues that I needed information about and treatment for, because I have had all of those things. But I like short, to the point answers, and I don\\'t need those answers delivered while someone is holding my hand. Frankly, I would find that type of delivery uncomfortable and irritating, but I fully understand that some people need that, and there\\'s nothing wrong with that, de gustibus non est disputandum. If you are looking for a doctor who is smart, knows what she\\'s doing and efficient, Dr. Weinstein is a wonderful choice. If you need all those things AND you need someone to spend 30-60 minutes with you at every appointment, going over every detail and answering every Web MD question you found, Dr. Weinstein probably is not the right choice for you. But, that doesn\\'t make her a bad doctor by any stretch of the imagination. Not every doctor is a perfect fit for every patient.One other thing to add, and this was very important to me, was the efficiency of that office. As others have noted, people often wait up to an hour to see their doctor, which I find horrific and endlessly frustrating. Dr. Weinstein\\'s office is run very well and rarely do I wait to see her (though it has happened a few times). For a working professional who has to go to a midday appointment sometimes, that efficiency is very important. It\\'s the difference between taking a vacation day and taking an \"\"extended lunch\"\". Her staff (nurses, admins, etc.) are knowledgeable, helpful and get back to you right away. All in all, I think the practice is great and Dr. Weinstein is great and I would highly recommend both.\",D72vZfie6Tb9QiOonmq2ow\\n11/30/2017,5.0,\"Dr Cindy Baskin really is the best doctor I\\'ve ever seen.

He is by far, the best doctor I have ever had. I was living in Manhattan when I first met Dr. Kraft. I now live over an hour away in East Brunswick, NJ and still drive all the way to the Westside of Manhattan to see Dr. Kraft -- he\\'s that good. Dr. Kraft is the first, and one of the only, doctors I have ever had that really seems to genuinely care about his patients. And while I understand that most doctors aren\\'t known for their bedside manners, you can only imagine how much nicer it is to have a great doctor who shows a very concerned and compassionate side when you are sick. One of the things I really appreciate is the time Dr. Kraft puts into an appointment. He is extremely calm and patient; not the slightest bit alarmist. Most appointments start with a sit down interview to help Dr. Kraft understand what\\'s bothering you. The exam, diagnosis, and treatment plan come next. And finally, you finish with another sit down interview where Dr. Kraft will give you the time to answer any questions you may have. This could all take a couple of minutes, or it could take a half hour or more. It all depends on your situation. Dr. Kraft will never rush his patients in and out of the office or treat them like they\\'re on an assembly line.Yes, the downside of this can be longer than normal wait times for your appointment to start. Most of the time, though, my appointments have started on time or within 10 minutes of the scheduled time. There have been a couple of instances where it has taken longer, but both of the those instances came on a day where I had to make a last minute appointment for the same day -- something Dr. Kraft has always managed to accommodate. I am more than happy to deal with this to have access to such a great doctor.Dr. Kraft truly is the real deal. No matter how sick you might be, you\\'ll always go in to see him knowing that he is your best shot at figuring out how to get you healthy again. He\\'s not a part-time comedian, cracking jokes, like some doctors try to be. He\\'s very serious, very down to earth, and very committed to helping you solve whatever is ailing you. I cannot recommend him highly enough.\",D72vZfie6Tb9QiOonmq2ow\\n10/26/2015,5.0,\"Those reading probably think I am nuts for updating but I have so much love for this practice even years later.I find this practice to be amazing because whether you call for insurance referrals or to make appointments everything is handled happily, quickly, and efficiently. And if I have to come in the check in / check out is really a 3 second process. And I have never waited more than 10 minutes to be seen. I love the nurses here because they are the nicest but also the most gentle with blood draw (tiny veins over here). And Dr. Baskin is really the gold standard of doctors. I\\'ve come to her sometimes really sick or really hurt but she manages to be really calming and reassuring and likes to joke about things like people talking way too loud on the train home on their phones. She\\'s definitely helped me so much over the years not only heal from whatever ails me but to de-escalate fears I may have had along the way. She is also a major advocate of trying other lines of defense rather than medicating at the first symptom which I love. And if this isn\\'t amazing enough she\\'s always reachable via Weill Cornell connect and usually answers questions the day of. And although I would love if no one reading this made an appointment with her because she\\'s already too popular as is I so wouldn\\'t blame you!

After a lot of stressful searching (many OBs and midwives won\\'t take you as a new patient after so many weeks), I have found a midwife at a different hospital who is refreshingly open and informative. Dr. Weinstein is not very sensitive or responsive to my concerns but seems focused on getting me out the door and keeping my mouth shut. Our visits tend to take about 90 seconds, after which she asks us if we have any questions while looking like she wants to run out of the room. She answers the questions as curtly as possible and any information we bring up is immediately dismissed, or she becomes defensive as though we were challenging her personally rather than trying to become informed. I kept thinking, \"\"Maybe she is just having a bad day,\"\" but the last visit was so troubling that I had to switch out of her practice. I can\\'t speak to her competence because luckily I have a low-risk pregnancy so I\\'m not sure how she would handle adverse conditions (and when we asked her what her philosophy/plans look like, she shut us down and refused to have a conversation about it). I say if you want to try her, give it a shot, but trust your gut and switch doctors early on instead of waiting until it\\'s (almost) too late like I did.

She doesn\\'t explain anything at all, refuses to show any compassion or anything and is completely condescending.

She is the quiet kind not really chatty but she answered all of our questions thoroughly and was really patient with us.I am almost ready to give birth now and I am hoping that she will be there to deliver my baby boy. She has been amazing and supportive through out the process. We had a few issues during our 2nd trimester, this doctor always made sure to call us and talk to us after every \"\"specialist\"\" visits. It meant a lot to us because it was a difficult time in our life. She made sure all the test were done and no stone was left unturned.I am happy to say it was all a false scare and everything is fine.I will always be grateful to this doctor for being there for my family.. also a plus the wait time is never that long.

After referrals for Dr. Weinstein I was very surprised by her lack of compassion and empathy. I had a miscarriage and she treated it in a very clinical manner. She handled it abruptly, didn\\'t explain anything, and brushed aside any thoughts I might have. She also didn\\'t tell me how to take my meds correctly (apparently there are tricks to the trade) so I have to take a second dose because the first dose didn\\'t work. I am not looking forward to doing this as the experience is quite painful. Adding to the bad experience was her med tech who told me, \"\"This type of thing is so hard for me. I hate my job on days like this\"\". As I sat crying, I felt so bad that my miscarriage made her day rough. Not. Ha! Anyway, Dr. Greening was the doctor on call and had great bedside manner which is important to me. She gave me her personal line and has texted with me which is very nice as I am going through a difficult time. A night and day experience, Dr. Greening handled my follow up and was so patient and explained everything. Wish I had seen her from the start. It was a night and day experience. Do NOT recommend Weinstein but wholeheartedly recommend Greening.\",D72vZfie6Tb9QiOonmq2ow\\n11/8/2018,4.0,\"Dr. Carolyn B. Hiltebeitel is an excellent Pediatrician. The nurse/PA Yulia S. who saw us before the doctor was terrible. She had no patience and behaved very poorly with my 1 yr old son who is very scared of doctor\\'s visits. She made the start of the visit horrible and unnecessarily difficult. My son cried and screamed the whole time clinging onto me while she did the measurement. In contrast, Dr. Carolyn B. Hiltebeitel and Richard S. were amazing. Richard S. gave my son 4 shots and he only cried a tiny bit with the last shot. Richard was patient, and had excellent bedside manners. Dr. Hiltebeitel was similarly patient, calm and caring. It was a disappointing way to start our first visit given the lack of care and patience Yulia S. had. I will go back, only if Yulia S. is NOT assisting my son.\",D72vZfie6Tb9QiOonmq2ow\\n8/16/2018,5.0,\"I can see where both sides of the reviews are coming from on Doctor Weinstein, but I have to say that I think she is great. First, I will say that I have been seeing her for many years and she has gotten noticeably more friendly and helpful over the years, she really seems to care about me and my health. When I first started seeing her she was a little more distant but that has changed dramatically. She has become more friendly, she spends more time with me in appointments, and is very patient with me, never rushing out to the next appointment.I have had some issues with a recent pregnancy and she has been extremely helpful - calling me back as soon as I call her, reaching out of her own accord to check on me, being patient and answering all my questions, making time for me in her busy schedule for multiple emergency appointments, etc. She has been immensely accommodating. Compared to other doctors I have dealt with recently, she is a treat.As for the people who say there was not enough hand holding and question answering, etc. - I don\\'t disagree that Dr. Weinstein is not the coddling type, but it\\'s not necessarily a negative. I have friends who have hours of questions for their OBGYN at every appointment, are scared of everything, have read every article there is about pregnancies going awry, are convinced things are wrong with them, and need someone to calm them down. If that\\'s you, Dr. Weinstein might not be the best fit (though again, I think she has changed very much as a doctor over the years and is very compassionate). I suspect that the people writing negative reviews probably fall more in that camp than my camp, of pregnant women who are pretty calm, have few questions, are not nervous and don\\'t need a lot of hand holding. That\\'s not to say I haven\\'t had a million questions over the years, as well as some serious issues that I needed information about and treatment for, because I have had all of those things. But I like short, to the point answers, and I don\\'t need those answers delivered while someone is holding my hand. Frankly, I would find that type of delivery uncomfortable and irritating, but I fully understand that some people need that, and there\\'s nothing wrong with that, de gustibus non est disputandum. If you are looking for a doctor who is smart, knows what she\\'s doing and efficient, Dr. Weinstein is a wonderful choice. If you need all those things AND you need someone to spend 30-60 minutes with you at every appointment, going over every detail and answering every Web MD question you found, Dr. Weinstein probably is not the right choice for you. But, that doesn\\'t make her a bad doctor by any stretch of the imagination. Not every doctor is a perfect fit for every patient.One other thing to add, and this was very important to me, was the efficiency of that office. As others have noted, people often wait up to an hour to see their doctor, which I find horrific and endlessly frustrating. Dr. Weinstein\\'s office is run very well and rarely do I wait to see her (though it has happened a few times). For a working professional who has to go to a midday appointment sometimes, that efficiency is very important. It\\'s the difference between taking a vacation day and taking an \"\"extended lunch\"\". Her staff (nurses, admins, etc.) are knowledgeable, helpful and get back to you right away. All in all, I think the practice is great and Dr. Weinstein is great and I would highly recommend both.\",D72vZfie6Tb9QiOonmq2ow\\n11/30/2017,5.0,\"Dr Cindy Baskin really is the best doctor I\\'ve ever seen.

He is by far, the best doctor I have ever had. I was living in Manhattan when I first met Dr. Kraft. I now live over an hour away in East Brunswick, NJ and still drive all the way to the Westside of Manhattan to see Dr. Kraft -- he\\'s that good. Dr. Kraft is the first, and one of the only, doctors I have ever had that really seems to genuinely care about his patients. And while I understand that most doctors aren\\'t known for their bedside manners, you can only imagine how much nicer it is to have a great doctor who shows a very concerned and compassionate side when you are sick. One of the things I really appreciate is the time Dr. Kraft puts into an appointment. He is extremely calm and patient; not the slightest bit alarmist. Most appointments start with a sit down interview to help Dr. Kraft understand what\\'s bothering you. The exam, diagnosis, and treatment plan come next. And finally, you finish with another sit down interview where Dr. Kraft will give you the time to answer any questions you may have. This could all take a couple of minutes, or it could take a half hour or more. It all depends on your situation. Dr. Kraft will never rush his patients in and out of the office or treat them like they\\'re on an assembly line.Yes, the downside of this can be longer than normal wait times for your appointment to start. Most of the time, though, my appointments have started on time or within 10 minutes of the scheduled time. There have been a couple of instances where it has taken longer, but both of the those instances came on a day where I had to make a last minute appointment for the same day -- something Dr. Kraft has always managed to accommodate. I am more than happy to deal with this to have access to such a great doctor.Dr. Kraft truly is the real deal. No matter how sick you might be, you\\'ll always go in to see him knowing that he is your best shot at figuring out how to get you healthy again. He\\'s not a part-time comedian, cracking jokes, like some doctors try to be. He\\'s very serious, very down to earth, and very committed to helping you solve whatever is ailing you. I cannot recommend him highly enough.\",D72vZfie6Tb9QiOonmq2ow\\n10/26/2015,5.0,\"Those reading probably think I am nuts for updating but I have so much love for this practice even years later.I find this practice to be amazing because whether you call for insurance referrals or to make appointments everything is handled happily, quickly, and efficiently. And if I have to come in the check in / check out is really a 3 second process. And I have never waited more than 10 minutes to be seen. I love the nurses here because they are the nicest but also the most gentle with blood draw (tiny veins over here). And Dr. Baskin is really the gold standard of doctors. I\\'ve come to her sometimes really sick or really hurt but she manages to be really calming and reassuring and likes to joke about things like people talking way too loud on the train home on their phones. She\\'s definitely helped me so much over the years not only heal from whatever ails me but to de-escalate fears I may have had along the way. She is also a major advocate of trying other lines of defense rather than medicating at the first symptom which I love. And if this isn\\'t amazing enough she\\'s always reachable via Weill Cornell connect and usually answers questions the day of. And although I would love if no one reading this made an appointment with her because she\\'s already too popular as is I so wouldn\\'t blame you!

After a lot of stressful searching (many OBs and midwives won\\'t take you as a new patient after so many weeks), I have found a midwife at a different hospital who is refreshingly open and informative. Dr. Weinstein is not very sensitive or responsive to my concerns but seems focused on getting me out the door and keeping my mouth shut. Our visits tend to take about 90 seconds, after which she asks us if we have any questions while looking like she wants to run out of the room. She answers the questions as curtly as possible and any information we bring up is immediately dismissed, or she becomes defensive as though we were challenging her personally rather than trying to become informed. I kept thinking, \"\"Maybe she is just having a bad day,\"\" but the last visit was so troubling that I had to switch out of her practice. I can\\'t speak to her competence because luckily I have a low-risk pregnancy so I\\'m not sure how she would handle adverse conditions (and when we asked her what her philosophy/plans look like, she shut us down and refused to have a conversation about it). I say if you want to try her, give it a shot, but trust your gut and switch doctors early on instead of waiting until it\\'s (almost) too late like I did. The relief I feel now that I can talk openly about my wishes and concerns to my new midwife is making me feel a lot more confident about giving birth for the first time!\",D72vZfie6Tb9QiOonmq2ow\\n1/11/2017,5.0,\"I have to say that after reading the mixed reviews on Dr. Weinstein I was a bit hesitant at first to go and see her.

I had a scheduled c section as my baby was on the larger side and breech. Dr Weinstein walked me through it and literally held my hand as I was a nervous wreck.

Everyone is talking about how rude she is, how she dissappears when you need her, and what an horrible experience they had when they gave birth just because of her. And this is wrong!

She made me feel like I could do it and I did! Also during all my well visits, I never waited more than 5-10 minutes to see her, which is so rare with docs. We are also seeing Dr. May Chu as our pediatrician and she is AWESOME! Seriously, so warm and gives great info.

Unfortunately, for the last decade, I didn\\'t have insurance I could use in her office, so when I finally switched to a provider Weill Cornell would take, I actually did a happy dance because I could go back to her for my yearly visits and she could be my OBGYN when my husband and I decide to start a family.

Dr. Erica Weinstein has TERRIBLE bedside manner, just to reiterate what other reviews have stated. She is really plain awful. She doesn\\'t explain anything at all, refuses to show any compassion or anything and is completely condescending. She has awful availability so you almost always must take the entire day off from work to meet with her, and when you get in the office, she rushes you out in 5-8 minutes. I depend on my What to Expect app more than I rely on her for support, advice and guidance through my pregnancy. I am 36 weeks now, and just went for my third trimester ultrasound. I really wanted a print out for my baby picture frame. She refused to give me one and refused to offer me a clear view of the screen. It is pretty late for me to switch doctors I think, but I will still see what I can do. I now realize how much I do not want her to be in the delivery room with me, and I find myself praying one of the other doctors will be available.

After a lot of stressful searching (many OBs and midwives won\\'t take you as a new patient after so many weeks), I have found a midwife at a different hospital who is refreshingly open and informative. Dr. Weinstein is not very sensitive or responsive to my concerns but seems focused on getting me out the door and keeping my mouth shut. Our visits tend to take about 90 seconds, after which she asks us if we have any questions while looking like she wants to run out of the room. She answers the questions as curtly as possible and any information we bring up is immediately dismissed, or she becomes defensive as though we were challenging her personally rather than trying to become informed. I kept thinking, \"\"Maybe she is just having a bad day,\"\" but the last visit was so troubling that I had to switch out of her practice. I can\\'t speak to her competence because luckily I have a low-risk pregnancy so I\\'m not sure how she would handle adverse conditions (and when we asked her what her philosophy/plans look like, she shut us down and refused to have a conversation about it). I say if you want to try her, give it a shot, but trust your gut and switch doctors early on instead of waiting until it\\'s (almost) too late like I did. The relief I feel now that I can talk openly about my wishes and concerns to my new midwife is making me feel a lot more confident about giving birth for the first time!\",D72vZfie6Tb9QiOonmq2ow\\n1/11/2017,5.0,\"I have to say that after reading the mixed reviews on Dr. Weinstein I was a bit hesitant at first to go and see her. I have to admit, she exceeded my expectations and I am very satisfied to have her as my physician and caring for our first pregnancy. She is very sweet, takes her time with me during my appointments and always makes sure to answer my questions. Even to the point that if I don\\'t have any questions, she asks me and wants to make sure all my concerns are well taken care of. I would highly recommend her and the practice\",D72vZfie6Tb9QiOonmq2ow\\n10/20/2016,5.0,\"I highly recommend this practice and all the Drs and nurses on staff here. Dr. Erica Weinstein was my primary OB/ GYN but another Dr. on her team delivered my twins via emergency C-section. I thought Dr. Weinstein was excellent in the care she provided before the twins were born and all of the visits she was very informative as well as receptive to our questions. In the hospital, Dr. Weinstein and the other Dr\\'s on her team ( I cannot remember their names unfortunately) were fabulous! They were at my bedside regularly to check on my pregnancy and after to check on my twins as well as myself. I highly recommend this practice!\",D72vZfie6Tb9QiOonmq2ow\\n9/24/2015,5.0,\"I can\\'t say enough great things about this facility and the care I received. This was my first pregnancy and being a nurse I am not the best patient. Dr Weinstein was patient and informative. She made the entire process easy and calmed my nerves. I never waited more than 10 mins to be seen and the appointments although short, I was always provided with all the information needed with all questions answered. I had a scheduled c section as my baby was on the larger side and breech. Dr Weinstein walked me through it and literally held my hand as I was a nervous wreck. I now have my healthy baby boy thanks to all the great care I received. I\\'ll definitely keep her in mind for my next pregnancy!\",D72vZfie6Tb9QiOonmq2ow\\n5/30/2016,5.0,Dr Erica Weinstein and her staff were amazing! They were on top of my case the day I called and told them something wasn\\'t right about my pregnancy. They made my ectopic journey more manageable than I thought. Always prompt with the results and always ready to accommodate! Great team! :),D72vZfie6Tb9QiOonmq2ow\\n9/9/2015,1.0,\"I wonder why does this hospital still keep that doctor? Erika Weinstein! I was planning to have my labor there, but after reading all these awfull reviews and some very concerning ones on the other websites as well now I am scared that I might have to deal with her if she is the on call doctor during my labor. vitals.com/doctors/Dr_Er…I read tens of times that she made pregnant women cry before or during labor. Everyone is talking about how rude she is, how she dissappears when you need her, and what an horrible experience they had when they gave birth just because of her. And this is wrong! Weill Cornell should do something about it. It is the most important day of your life and it\\'s not fair at all to remember that day with regrett and sadness...\",D72vZfie6Tb9QiOonmq2ow\\n6/19/2014,5.0,\"My experience with Weill Cornell docs has been fantastic. Dr. Erica Weinstein is my OB/GYN and she was wonderful during my recent delivery. I had a very big boy, nearly 10 pounds, and she was a great combo of an experienced doctor and a comforting coach. She made me feel like I could do it and I did! Also during all my well visits, I never waited more than 5-10 minutes to see her, which is so rare with docs. We are also seeing Dr. May Chu as our pediatrician and she is AWESOME! Seriously, so warm and gives great info. During our first visit, she probably spent 30-45 minutes with us answering all our questions. She never rushes us and is so great with our son. So happy with this office!\",D72vZfie6Tb9QiOonmq2ow\\n6/19/2015,1.0,\"Dr. Erica Weinstein botched my delivery so badly that my son ended up in the NICU for two weeks with suspected oxygen deprivation, pneumonia, and potential brain damage. He was sedated and in a brain-cooling tank for 3 days and then on antibiotics. She deserves to lose her license for her actions. She is the worst OB in the city (I have seen many over the years) and I beg anyone considering seeing her please go elsewhere.\",D72vZfie6Tb9QiOonmq2ow\\n10/1/2015,5.0,\"Nothing but wonderful things to say about Weill Cornell\\'s office on 72nd Street. My husband, 2 sons and I have gone there for all of our medical care for more than 7 years now and they all treat us like family. I would highlight Ob/Gyn Dr. Erica Weinstein who just helped me through a complicated pregnancy and delivered our second son this past month. She is always available and ready to answer all of my questions - no matter how small. She was a big reason I chose the office, and I\\'m so thankful for her! The office staff is also just fantastic! Always courteous and quick to fit you in if you need a last minute appointment. They are always friendly and know us by name every time we walk in the office.\",D72vZfie6Tb9QiOonmq2ow\\n9/5/2014,5.0,\"Dr. Kelly Greening was the very first OBGYN I saw when I moved to NYC 14 years ago. I was 18 at the time and hadn\\'t had many \"\"lady appointments\"\" yet, but even with my limited experience I could tell she was fantastic. Unfortunately, for the last decade, I didn\\'t have insurance I could use in her office, so when I finally switched to a provider Weill Cornell would take, I actually did a happy dance because I could go back to her for my yearly visits and she could be my OBGYN when my husband and I decide to start a family. Seriously. A happy dance. She is professional, knowledgeable, caring, and patient. I have never felt rushed in her office and I am always comfortably asking her questions. She just has this air about her- you know you\\'re in excellent hands. I highly recommend her!!\",D72vZfie6Tb9QiOonmq2ow\\n5/22/2016,1.0,\"This is my first pregnancy and it took me forever to find an OB under my insurance that was affiliated with a good hospital, causing me to start my prenatal care a bit later than recommended. Dr. Erica Weinstein has TERRIBLE bedside manner, just to reiterate what other reviews have stated. She is really plain awful. She doesn\\'t explain anything at all, refuses to show any compassion or anything and is completely condescending. She has awful availability so you almost always must take the entire day off from work to meet with her, and when you get in the office, she rushes you out in 5-8 minutes. I depend on my What to Expect app more than I rely on her for support, advice and guidance through my pregnancy. I am 36 weeks now, and just went for my third trimester ultrasound. I really wanted a print out for my baby picture frame. She refused to give me one and refused to offer me a clear view of the screen. It is pretty late for me to switch doctors I think, but I will still see what I can do. I now realize how much I do not want her to be in the delivery room with me, and I find myself praying one of the other doctors will be available. DO NOT GO TO HER.\",D72vZfie6Tb9QiOonmq2ow\\n9/11/2014,5.0,\"LOVE Dr. Erica Weinstein!I was looking for an OB when I found out I was expecting our second child. Came across her name in the internet but wasn\\'t thrilled with the reviews. Later decided to give her office a call and just try her out. They were so accommodating! Dr. Weinstein came early at 8:30am to squeeze me in on her booked up day and we were impressed. She is the quiet kind not really chatty but she answered all of our questions thoroughly and was really patient with us.I am almost ready to give birth now and I am hoping that she will be there to deliver my baby boy. She has been amazing and supportive through out the process. We had a few issues during our 2nd trimester, this doctor always made sure to call us and talk to us after every \"\"specialist\"\" visits. It meant a lot to us because it was a difficult time in our life. She made sure all the test were done and no stone was left unturned.I am happy to say it was all a false scare and everything is fine.I will always be grateful to this doctor for being there for my family.. also a plus the wait time is never that long. I hope there are more doctors out there like her. Her staff is also wonderful especially the nurse!\",D72vZfie6Tb9QiOonmq2ow\\n11/10/2013,5.0,\"I am a patient of Dr. Painter and Dr. Greening, and my son is a patient of Dr. Rosenberg. These are superb medical professionals who offer exceptional care, with such thoroughness and thoughtfulness.

After referrals for Dr. Weinstein I was very surprised by her lack of compassion and empathy. I had a miscarriage and she treated it in a very clinical manner. She handled it abruptly, didn\\'t explain anything, and brushed aside any thoughts I might have. She also didn\\'t tell me how to take my meds correctly (apparently there are tricks to the trade) so I have to take a second dose because the first dose didn\\'t work. I am not looking forward to doing this as the experience is quite painful. Adding to the bad experience was her med tech who told me, \"\"This type of thing is so hard for me. I hate my job on days like this\"\". As I sat crying, I felt so bad that my miscarriage made her day rough. Not. Ha! Anyway, Dr. Greening was the doctor on call and had great bedside manner which is important to me. She gave me her personal line and has texted with me which is very nice as I am going through a difficult time. A night and day experience, Dr. Greening handled my follow up and was so patient and explained everything. Wish I had seen her from the start. It was a night and day experience. Do NOT recommend Weinstein but wholeheartedly recommend Greening.\",D72vZfie6Tb9QiOonmq2ow\\n6/12/2018,5.0,\"Dr. Bleyer has been my primary doctor for about a decade. I\\'m a big fan.

I found out via vague google search that she has a dog who has attacked several people in her building, is being sued for it, and still refuses to muzzle him. I thought that seemed questionable, but her reviews were all great, so I went for it. The appointment was wonderful, I never had a doc take such a comprehensive history. I genuinely liked her and was so glad I decided to go with her. I was relieved to have found a new doc that I like and trust! Fast forward six months: I still have no idea what my bloodwork said, and I was going in for a chronic thing that needs to be monitored via blookwork! I think this is insane.\",O6t1g8JtFKnHhqdgYsc1rw\\n2/1/2015,1.0,Sad to say I had similar issues with Dr Bleyers office. I went in for a physical 6-8 months ago and have yet to receive my results!!

The office is clean and Joelle was a nice doctor but I have nothing else nice to say about the location. First, the front staff are nothing but rude every time I call. They have a lazy tone of voice and like any question you have for them is putting them out.Second, The billing woman is never in, and difficult to reach. I finally had to get her personal cell phone to get in touch with her.Third and most importantly, the entire year of doctors appointments I had with them they were sending my lab work to an OUT OF NETWORK LAB. I now owe Biolab over $1500 in lab bills that would have regularly been covered by an IN-network lab. Manhattan Family will do nothing about this and said it was my fault that I didnt ask for it to be sent to an in network lab. When I shared this story with my dermatologist she said that is outrageous and doctors offices should always double check in and out of network labs before sending work out. Needless to say I am very, very unhappy with the lack of patient responsibility Manhattan Family Practice displayed and I hope this review helps future patients make better choices than I did on selecting a medical practice.\",AEMBNLVBl6A-2kqIIL9hBA\\n8/24/2016,5.0,\"I am not an easy patient: obese, clinical anxiety, vasovagal reaction to blood being drawn, and white coat syndrome regarding blood pressure. Dr. Pulcheri didn\\'t minimize any of my concerns, and joked back with me when I used self-deprecating humor. She listened, offered her opinion, asked me to think about some things (like a pap smear, which I haven\\'t in years), and offered advice without judgement. Basically, exactly what you\\'d want from a doctor: and what is now so ridiculously hard to find. The clincher for me, though, was that she decided to take all my vitals and bloodwork herself, rather than being in her assistant - as she thought that would make more anxious.

I especially liked that he explained conditions in detail, complete with diagrams, so that medical care felt like a team effort. Unfortunately, for health insurance reasons, I had to be switched over to Dr. David Kaplowitz (not associated with MFP - but a different practice that rents out the same office space) - not so attentive, not so professional. Perhaps Dr. K was attempting to be flirty and funny, but he came off as lecherous and condescending. Both times I saw him. He joked about how he still hadn\\'t looked up my condition, and asked me about my \"\"womanly stuff.\"\" I had to ask him to clarify, since I\\'m used to doctors referring to PAP smears or STD screenings by their proper terms. He was otherwise dismissive, and, frankly, disrespectful. Rarely do I have a bad experience with doctors, but I felt like I needed a hot shower after seeing Dr. Kaplowitz. His arrogant and leering demeanor was overwhelming. His office charged an exorbitant amount to my health insurance for doing nothing more than checking my blood pressure (which a med student did) and writing a couple prescriptions. Furthermore, I was so icked out by my experience with him that when I went to write a review on Vitals, I noticed another female patient had written very similar comments a few weeks prior. Clearly I\\'m not the only one getting creeped out by the guy. However, a month later - both our reviews are gone, and replaced with glowing, and dubious, recommendations talking about how \"\"handsome\"\" and non-sexist and respectful and funny Dr. Kaplowitz is. Puh-lease. Deleting negative reviews and replacing them with fake ones stroking his own ego? One would hope he\\'d spend all that time taking some refresher courses in appropriate bedside manner instead. I highly recommend Dr. Levy, but avoid Dr. Kaplowitz at all costs~!\",AEMBNLVBl6A-2kqIIL9hBA\\n11/3/2010,5.0,\"I don\\'t have a doctor in New York, and found Dr. Dana Jacobs through my insurance (based entirely on location).

I have been sick with a mysterious illness for over three months and misdiagnosed twice.Dr. Levy is the only doctor out of the 5 doctors I have seen who was able to help me. I used to go to Mt. Sinai but I feel like I am in way better hands at Manhattan Family Practice. Everyone there is very nice and I don\\'t just feel like a number when I walk in. I have never been this sick in my life so it was very frustrating and scary to not be able to figure out what was wrong with me as well as not be able to find a doctor that would listen to me.

Levy and his office has been voted the best primary care doctor in NYC for almost 10 years in a row. If you have had a bad doctor that is when you can appreciate the great ones! It is my understanding that Dr. Levy no longer takes insurance. He takes cash only now. Also the doctors from Family Practice only rent space from him now and do not share in his practice any more. Having said all of that any doctor you choose at 911 Park Avenue is outstanding! What I liked about it when it was Family Practice (it is no longer called Family Practice) is you could go to any of the doctors at any time and get great care. Now you are restricted to going to your personal doctor. Never the less they are the top doctors in the city and deserve their reputation. They are the best of the best! Going to the right doctor can mean the difference between quality of life and just surviving or even life and death!

Most of my visits are mainly due to physicals and immunizations needed for work and school. Dr. Vi mainly work less hours a week so I have been seeing Dr. Peter due to convenience of my schedule. Both are professional and knowledgeable doctors with good bedside manners. They will take time in assessing and listening to your concerns. Maria has been their steady assistant and she\\'s equally an asset to this clinic. Based from what I have heard, they even would give you options on your referral base on your location convenience and insurance. They have solid clientele so appointments a must.\",XWalu9bpZxqV5ABsYokeOw\\n7/30/2018,1.0,\"Don\\'t go here if you\\'re a new patient. They don\\'t care for new patients at all as you see in the other reviews. If you\\'ve never been there, be prepared to be hung up on or just given the run around til you hang up. Their assistant who picks up the phone has a brain the size of a dust particle. I explained to her I am sick with something pretty contagious and Dr Peter is my primary care physician for my insurance. She tells me it doesnt matter and if I\\'ve never seen the doctor before and that I\\'d have to wait at least a week. I just told you I\\'m contagious with what I have and what I have you know can be resolved with some medication and 15 minutes of your time. But apparently that\\'s not worth it for you and it seems like for a doctors office, you\\'re okay with me to just continue to be contagious as it is not your problem. So are you they really doctors who want to help heal people or more like just some people who want to get their day booked, get their money and go home without a worry? Cause a real doctor would help you and not just turn you away when you\\'re sick and contagious? A real doctor would take 5 minutes to consider your appointment request and any assistant with a brain would take into consideration when someone says they\\'re pretty contagious with something. Not oh, \"\" if you cant wait then go to the hospital\"\". Yeah like I didnt think of that fir$t, that\\'s how dumb their assistant is. The people you hire reflect on you and your business. If your assistant is dismissive and not even attempting to listen or be helpful in the least, that kind of tells me what kind of doctors these guys are to hire someone like that. These guys are either not real doctors who actually care for their patient and their assistant is simply just dimwitted. If you cant even hire an assistant who is competent with common sense or human decency, what makes me want to trust you with my health and body? Are you even real doctors if someone contagious with something asks you for a few minutes of your time to just check out what it is, and you already turn them away? What would happen if it was something serious that the patient could not identify properly? Would you just tell them to go away? Or oh yeah, lets wait a week til it gets worst and you become less treatable? Don\\'t go here if you\\'re a new patient looking for a doctor. They don\\'t care. If they don\\'t care about you enough to stay a few minutes longer in their day to check you out when you say you have something contagious, what makes you think they\\'ll care about you if they\\'re off duty and you\\'re sick and in need of real medical attention? You think a place that doesnt even care that you\\'re contagiously sick and will make you wait a week with no exceptions will give you extra care or careful medical attention? Pft, yeah right. This is not a personal medical center with a personal touch. It\\'s more of a wam bam whats wrong with you, here\\'s your diagnosis and prescription, now go away. That\\'s even if you get an appointment before you cause an outbreak. There are plenty of doctors offices who dont treat you poorly and actually have staff that listen to what you\\'re actually saying. I immediately changed my primary care physician after this. Horrible Service. No common sense or human decency.They give me the impression that they treat patients more like customers who buy rather than a person who is sick and needs medical care. Look at all the complaints about your assistant. Fire this useless dumb robot before it\\'s too late and hire someone who can think on their feet. The worst part is that she didnt even try asking the doctor if he maybe could fit me in or even think longer than 3 seconds about my request. She just said sorry too bad. I really felt like I was at the DMV.I don\\'t even yelp review ever(and you can check that), but after realizing how dumb the assistant was, for someone who works at a doctors office that\\'s suppose to help treat sick people, I really felt the need to warn others so they dont waste their time. This is not a restaurant, where the food was bad and the waiter was inattentive and you can give them a second chance. We\\'re not talking about food, we\\'re talking about your health and body here. It\\'s a doctors office with a staff that has no common sense or human decency. Those are red flags if I ever saw one. Why would I trust you with my health long term when you can\\'t even fulfill a simple request? What happens when I have something serious I can\\'t fully identify or describe and your assistant just dismisses it because she feels it can wait a week?You can tell by how many hours they work, they just want to fill their hours and go home. They dont really care about healing or helping people.Btw, I called another office, had a girl tell me she\\'s booked this week too. I asked to speak to the doctor and guess what, she made space in her schedule tomorrow after hearing my condition and concerns. It took less than 5 minutes. No muss No fuss.\",XWalu9bpZxqV5ABsYokeOw\\n9/29/2015,5.0,\"I gave Dr. Vi Laudureé Macarons as a holiday gift. I think you know where this review is headed.. However, I don\\'t think she\\'s accepting anymore new patients. Dr. Peter may still be. Dr. Vi has been my Primary Physician since 2012. Previously, my Primary was in Astoria and I was with her from 2005-2012. I spent the last years there telling her how I was just not feeling right & complained of various fatigue & pain. After answers of \"\"drink coffee after lunch, you\\'re young, eat more protein, take Vitamin D.\"\" And finally, \"\"When you\\'re sitting at work, make sure not to lean on the arm rest, because that can cause abdominal pain.\"\" I clearly don\\'t think that is the cause of my issue.I searched around & switched to Smart Health- thinking that it\\'s in a fairly convenient location, not far from the subway & takes my not-so-great insurance. With the first physical (the yearly\\'s take longer to schedule since they\\'re a longer appointment), Dr. Vi ran a full panel of bloodwork & eureka! found underlying chronic illnesses. Unfortunately to say, that her nice small staff and I are on a first name basis since then (between routine appointments, tests, & specialists), she has been the ONLY doctor of the many specialists that is advocating for my health woes and Medical Mysteries. She has even called up my specialists and spoken to them about my case. Even asked Dr. Peter (saw him as a walk-in once when she was on vacation AND he heard about my case!). It\\'s disconcerning when most Dr\\'s just brush you off \"\"Your symptoms are mild, you seem young & okay, come back in one year.\"\" Dr. Vi has attended conferences on holistic health, won\\'t over prescribe harmful medications, suggests acupuncture, yoga, Thai Chi, has researched food-based diets & emailed me the information, asks about my life & environmental living situation, & plain old wants to help. Appointments are never more than a 15min. wait. They\\'re open late on a few nights & are open on Saturdays. They don\\'t overschedule patients, once in a while I\\'ve forgotten referrals at my specialists & they were kind & quick enough to fax one over. Requests for prescription refills are fast as well. Bloodwork is taken on site. I believe Dr. Peter speaks Thai & Dr. Vi Vietnamese. Their nurse Maria speaks Tagalog & the receptionist speaks Mandarin. The patients are actually pretty diverse: young professionals, seniors from the Asian community, gay couples from Manhattan. There\\'s a nice relaxed Queens feel though. One critique is that sometimes Dr. Vi is TOO concerned. At first wondering if my apartment was making me ill & suggesting that I move (creating a bit of stress for me). Sending me for scary tests, while specialists weren\\'t (although I\\'d rather cover all my bases). Overall, I\\'m very thankful for Dr. Vi\\'s efforts & willingness to research & communicate with me.

Decided to visit Smart Health Medical and specifically see Dr. Vi and I was so pleased with my first visit I\\'ve never gone anywhere else in the last five years! The office accepts walk-ins (from what I remember written on the door, I could be wrong) as well as appointments, and they have great late night and weekend hours a couple times a week.I continue to see Dr. Vi for annual physicals, check-ups and any unknown symptoms even after moving to the Bronx. When I move out of the city someday I\\'ll be sad to leave Dr. Vi behind but while I\\'m here I cannot recommend her enough. As everyone says, she cares about her patients and takes her time with us. She actively listens and is so well versed in so many different types of treatments and good lifestyle habits.If you don\\'t need pills, she\\'\\'ll tell you that and offer up better everyday habits that can help you live and feel better. She takes a holistic approach to your health and is in no way a pill-pusher looking to make insurance money off you. Most of my visits result in a clean bill of health after taking vitals, and blood or urine samples on site--if necessary.But when you do need a scan, treatment or prescription she goes above and beyond to make sure you get exactly what you need, when you need it, and makes sure it\\'s covered under your insurance so you\\'re not hit with sticker shock at the pharmacy or referred specialist. The office even faxed my referral paperwork to a specialist when I forgot the paper at home before my appointment. Saved me from having to reschedule or take off work to go home and get it.I could go on and on but there\\'s no need.

Just saying. I saw him with only a two day notice for an annual checkup. Since this place isn\\'t a high volume, low profit factory that churns patients, Dr. Peter spent a lot of time discussing my health and also helped me with some holistic health ideas. On my follow up visit, he actually found how I was misdiagnosed by my military doctor. Drats, can\\'t sue the military. So, I\\'m out of luck there.

My health has been pretty stable as a young adult. Most of my visits are mainly due to physicals and immunizations needed for work and school. Dr. Vi mainly work less hours a week so I have been seeing Dr. Peter due to convenience of my schedule. Both are professional and knowledgeable doctors with good bedside manners. They will take time in assessing and listening to your concerns. Maria has been their steady assistant and she\\'s equally an asset to this clinic. Based from what I have heard, they even would give you options on your referral base on your location convenience and insurance. They have solid clientele so appointments a must.\",XWalu9bpZxqV5ABsYokeOw\\n7/30/2018,1.0,\"Don\\'t go here if you\\'re a new patient. They don\\'t care for new patients at all as you see in the other reviews. If you\\'ve never been there, be prepared to be hung up on or just given the run around til you hang up. Their assistant who picks up the phone has a brain the size of a dust particle. I explained to her I am sick with something pretty contagious and Dr Peter is my primary care physician for my insurance. She tells me it doesnt matter and if I\\'ve never seen the doctor before and that I\\'d have to wait at least a week. I just told you I\\'m contagious with what I have and what I have you know can be resolved with some medication and 15 minutes of your time. But apparently that\\'s not worth it for you and it seems like for a doctors office, you\\'re okay with me to just continue to be contagious as it is not your problem. So are you they really doctors who want to help heal people or more like just some people who want to get their day booked, get their money and go home without a worry? Cause a real doctor would help you and not just turn you away when you\\'re sick and contagious? A real doctor would take 5 minutes to consider your appointment request and any assistant with a brain would take into consideration when someone says they\\'re pretty contagious with something. Not oh, \"\" if you cant wait then go to the hospital\"\". Yeah like I didnt think of that fir$t, that\\'s how dumb their assistant is. The people you hire reflect on you and your business. If your assistant is dismissive and not even attempting to listen or be helpful in the least, that kind of tells me what kind of doctors these guys are to hire someone like that. These guys are either not real doctors who actually care for their patient and their assistant is simply just dimwitted. If you cant even hire an assistant who is competent with common sense or human decency, what makes me want to trust you with my health and body? Are you even real doctors if someone contagious with something asks you for a few minutes of your time to just check out what it is, and you already turn them away? What would happen if it was something serious that the patient could not identify properly? Would you just tell them to go away? Or oh yeah, lets wait a week til it gets worst and you become less treatable? Don\\'t go here if you\\'re a new patient looking for a doctor. They don\\'t care. If they don\\'t care about you enough to stay a few minutes longer in their day to check you out when you say you have something contagious, what makes you think they\\'ll care about you if they\\'re off duty and you\\'re sick and in need of real medical attention? You think a place that doesnt even care that you\\'re contagiously sick and will make you wait a week with no exceptions will give you extra care or careful medical attention? Pft, yeah right. This is not a personal medical center with a personal touch. It\\'s more of a wam bam whats wrong with you, here\\'s your diagnosis and prescription, now go away. That\\'s even if you get an appointment before you cause an outbreak. There are plenty of doctors offices who dont treat you poorly and actually have staff that listen to what you\\'re actually saying. I immediately changed my primary care physician after this. Horrible Service. No common sense or human decency.They give me the impression that they treat patients more like customers who buy rather than a person who is sick and needs medical care. Look at all the complaints about your assistant. Fire this useless dumb robot before it\\'s too late and hire someone who can think on their feet. The worst part is that she didnt even try asking the doctor if he maybe could fit me in or even think longer than 3 seconds about my request. She just said sorry too bad. I really felt like I was at the DMV.I don\\'t even yelp review ever(and you can check that), but after realizing how dumb the assistant was, for someone who works at a doctors office that\\'s suppose to help treat sick people, I really felt the need to warn others so they dont waste their time. This is not a restaurant, where the food was bad and the waiter was inattentive and you can give them a second chance. We\\'re not talking about food, we\\'re talking about your health and body here. It\\'s a doctors office with a staff that has no common sense or human decency. Those are red flags if I ever saw one. Why would I trust you with my health long term when you can\\'t even fulfill a simple request? What happens when I have something serious I can\\'t fully identify or describe and your assistant just dismisses it because she feels it can wait a week?You can tell by how many hours they work, they just want to fill their hours and go home. They dont really care about healing or helping people.Btw, I called another office, had a girl tell me she\\'s booked this week too. I asked to speak to the doctor and guess what, she made space in her schedule tomorrow after hearing my condition and concerns. It took less than 5 minutes. No muss No fuss.\",XWalu9bpZxqV5ABsYokeOw\\n9/29/2015,5.0,\"I gave Dr. Vi Laudureé Macarons as a holiday gift. I think you know where this review is headed.. However, I don\\'t think she\\'s accepting anymore new patients. Dr. Peter may still be. Dr. Vi has been my Primary Physician since 2012. Previously, my Primary was in Astoria and I was with her from 2005-2012. I spent the last years there telling her how I was just not feeling right & complained of various fatigue & pain. After answers of \"\"drink coffee after lunch, you\\'re young, eat more protein, take Vitamin D.\"\" And finally, \"\"When you\\'re sitting at work, make sure not to lean on the arm rest, because that can cause abdominal pain.\"\" I clearly don\\'t think that is the cause of my issue.I searched around & switched to Smart Health- thinking that it\\'s in a fairly convenient location, not far from the subway & takes my not-so-great insurance. With the first physical (the yearly\\'s take longer to schedule since they\\'re a longer appointment), Dr. Vi ran a full panel of bloodwork & eureka! found underlying chronic illnesses. Unfortunately to say, that her nice small staff and I are on a first name basis since then (between routine appointments, tests, & specialists), she has been the ONLY doctor of the many specialists that is advocating for my health woes and Medical Mysteries. She has even called up my specialists and spoken to them about my case. Even asked Dr. Peter (saw him as a walk-in once when she was on vacation AND he heard about my case!). It\\'s disconcerning when most Dr\\'s just brush you off \"\"Your symptoms are mild, you seem young & okay, come back in one year.\"\" Dr. Vi has attended conferences on holistic health, won\\'t over prescribe harmful medications, suggests acupuncture, yoga, Thai Chi, has researched food-based diets & emailed me the information, asks about my life & environmental living situation, & plain old wants to help. Appointments are never more than a 15min. wait. They\\'re open late on a few nights & are open on Saturdays. They don\\'t overschedule patients, once in a while I\\'ve forgotten referrals at my specialists & they were kind & quick enough to fax one over. Requests for prescription refills are fast as well. Bloodwork is taken on site. I believe Dr. Peter speaks Thai & Dr. Vi Vietnamese. Their nurse Maria speaks Tagalog & the receptionist speaks Mandarin. The patients are actually pretty diverse: young professionals, seniors from the Asian community, gay couples from Manhattan. There\\'s a nice relaxed Queens feel though. One critique is that sometimes Dr. Vi is TOO concerned. At first wondering if my apartment was making me ill & suggesting that I move (creating a bit of stress for me). Sending me for scary tests, while specialists weren\\'t (although I\\'d rather cover all my bases). Overall, I\\'m very thankful for Dr. Vi\\'s efforts & willingness to research & communicate with me. When you don\\'t feel well, the last thing you want is a Dr. that doesn\\'t listen or care.\",XWalu9bpZxqV5ABsYokeOw\\n1/20/2016,5.0,\"Years ago I was searching for a new doctor to see me after moving to Queens from upstate NY (Rochester). Decided to visit Smart Health Medical and specifically see Dr. Vi and I was so pleased with my first visit I\\'ve never gone anywhere else in the last five years! The office accepts walk-ins (from what I remember written on the door, I could be wrong) as well as appointments, and they have great late night and weekend hours a couple times a week.I continue to see Dr. Vi for annual physicals, check-ups and any unknown symptoms even after moving to the Bronx. When I move out of the city someday I\\'ll be sad to leave Dr. Vi behind but while I\\'m here I cannot recommend her enough. As everyone says, she cares about her patients and takes her time with us. She actively listens and is so well versed in so many different types of treatments and good lifestyle habits.If you don\\'t need pills, she\\'\\'ll tell you that and offer up better everyday habits that can help you live and feel better. She takes a holistic approach to your health and is in no way a pill-pusher looking to make insurance money off you. Most of my visits result in a clean bill of health after taking vitals, and blood or urine samples on site--if necessary.But when you do need a scan, treatment or prescription she goes above and beyond to make sure you get exactly what you need, when you need it, and makes sure it\\'s covered under your insurance so you\\'re not hit with sticker shock at the pharmacy or referred specialist. The office even faxed my referral paperwork to a specialist when I forgot the paper at home before my appointment. Saved me from having to reschedule or take off work to go home and get it.I could go on and on but there\\'s no need. Dr. Vi has been the best doctor I\\'ve ever seen in my 30 years who does more than anyone I\\'ve seen to care for her patient\\'s needs.\",XWalu9bpZxqV5ABsYokeOw\\n10/14/2016,1.0,\"If you are not willing to take any patient after 2.30pm, you should not said you are closed at 3pm.

Oh, and they play great music, too!Wait for the Dr. is always pretty short (less than 10 min) and I\\'m usually in and out in a jiffy. Dr. Vi has helped me with various blood tests, cholesterol, and basic health. Unfortunately I\\'ve since moved and my last visit was a few weeks ago.The office is in Elmhurst which may feel far for people like me in Astoria/LIC but it\\'s right off of the M/R line so it never took me more than 20 minutes door to door.

Kinda awesome. Once you meet Dr. Vi, you\\'ll wonder why all doctors aren\\'t like her. Patient and a great listener, she takes all your concerns into consideration and looks into it. I think the only imperfection I notice was the handling in paperwork. They didn\\'t realize that HMOs need referral authorizations before making appointments (maybe they usually have PPO patients?)

I searched online and found all the positive reviews of not only the practice but also DR. Vi.What I can honestly say is all those good things you read in those reviews are 100% accurate. Her bedside manner is top notch. She and her staff put me at ease the from the minute I walked in to when I walked out the door. Dr. Vi comes across as not only very intelligent but also very relatable on a human level which you don\\'t see from many docs these days. She took her time, talked to me like about little things like the fact that she\\'s read all the game of throne novels and when she realized I was paying out of pocket helped me as best as she could with the continuing cost of my healthcare. This is by far the best Medical Doctor I\\'ve been to and I plan to contiune using her and her office as my primary point of healthcare for the future. So if you haven\\'t figured it out by now...

For some reason, December was not a good month for me in terms of health issues but I feel very fortunate be in such good hands. Dr. Tsang goes above and beyond for his patients and is unbelievably compassionate.  For example, on Christmas eve I called Dr. Tsang from work and complained about head pains and an extremely swollen lymph node by my ear. He told me to come in immediately. I got there during his lunch break, but I decided to just sit and wait for an hour. By chance, Dr. Tsang came out of his office and didn\\'t even hesitate to see me, even though it was his lunch hour. Wow! I ended up having shingles and if he didn\\'t tell me to come in asap, I would not have been able to take the anti-viral medicine in time for it to have any benefits. It appeared that the shingles also infected my eye as well and he told me it was imperative to for me to see an ophthalmologist that day. I was not very optimistic considering it was Christmas Eve, but Dr. Tsang told me not to worry and that they would call around until they found someone that was available to see me. They also made sure that the ophthalmologist was covered by my health insurance. His front desk staff also made sure to provide me with a referral (even though I don\\'t need referrals for my insurance) just in case my insurance gave me any trouble. I was really astounded by the level of care that they provided. Dr. Tsang seemed very concerned and even asked me to update him after I visited the eye doctor. After this whole experience, there is no other doctor that I would want to go to.

The fact that he can bridge the gap between East and West medicine gives him such an incredible perspective and ability to understand the human body on so many levels. I saw him for about a year before I accepted his request to apply acupuncture to help with my asthma. I thought it was so crazy to think needles could cure my inability to breathe! But it\\'s been about 6 months since I\\'ve had to use an inhaler.

I was told I could come by and didnt need an appointment. I was told to come by any time and the wait would be only 10-15 mins. I came in the middle of my work day and waited 45 Min to be put into a closet of an examination room, only to be told it would be another 45 mins before the doctor could see me. 1.5hours before anything was done to me. They need to do a better job of managing expectations. The facilities are also substandard/dirty and their bedside manners are truly appalling.

Waited in the tiny, sterile room with the door closed for another 10 minutes, couldn\\'t take anymore and came out for air. Dr Tsang has 3 rooms where he sees 3 patients simultaneously, He was running between rooms. He finally came in to see me, took about 2 minutes to speak to me about my allergy symptoms and then said that he has a treatment for me and to lie back. He then proceeded to get the tub of needles out. I asked if by treatment he meant acupuncture and he said yes, but don\\'t worry, we only use the needles once!!Now good thing I am very familiar with acupuncture but would have been terrified if this was my first time. He didn\\'t even insert needles on all the energy points where others have done for me previously. Back 20 minutes later, removed needles, told me not to walk under any trees, to eat honey and come back on Tuesday and he was gone!! I tried asking about some symptoms but he couldn\\'t get out fast enough. I then went to make an appointment with the less than charming receptionist, she told me Wednesday or Thursday, made an appointment for Wednesday and then was told that they only take cash. WHEN I MENTIONED THAT NO ONE TOLD ME THIS ON THE PHONE, HER REPLY WAS, \"\"YOU DIDN\\'T ASK. I then went back down to a bank machine, came back, paid and told them to cancel my appointment.

Due to raving reviews on parent Facebook groups we registered with this practice. We\\'ve been there twice and not planning on returning. 1. Similar to other reviews, the practice expects you to go check your lab results yourself online - don\\'t expect a phone call or explanations. Happened for both visits. Oh, also it took me 2 phone calls, multiple emails and an in-person-visit to get a printout of the code to actually setup the online account.2. First time was an emergency visit with high fever - with Dr. Santos and a male nurse. I appreciated the last-minute-appointment and both were nice and great with my kid. 3. Second time was our 18 month check-up, with Dr. Sharma, and a female nurse. This was a total disaster. First my kid got attacked and shoved to the floor by an angry 6 or 7-year old in the waiting room. Not the practice\\'s fault, I realize that, but also no asking by staff whether my daughter was ok (which she was, but rattled). Then 45 min waiting. Then the nurse snapped at my daughter when she cried during the vital measurements (\"\"come on, I\\'m only measuring your head\"\"). My daughter is usually very good-natured, but does not like unknown people touching her. Obviously, at 18 months old, she can not rationalize a doctor visit. Then Dr. Sharma came in, and, how can I put this politely, was really unfriendly and condescending both with my kid and myself. I honestly do not understand the good reviews. Don\\'t tell my daughter \"\"at your 2-year-visit, you better talk!\"\". Don\\'t tell her she is \"\"fake\"\" when she cries because you are examining her. Don\\'t tell me \"\"I\\'ll better take your word for it\"\" when I say she is talking plenty at home (did I mention the being rattled and crying?). But the most \"\"fun\"\" part was the blood draw the nurse did. As she remarked, my daughter is \"\"a bleeder\"\", so her finger kept bleeding a lot and for a long time. Nurse just left us there sitting with bloody gauzes on the examination table, with one band-aid on my daughter\\'s finger, which was bled through in seconds and came off. Had to go through drawers for more gauze to stop the bleeding and more bandaids. Nobody saw us out. A month later I call (again) to get the blood results, to learn they are posted on healow - but beware, not under lab results, where I had been looking, but under \"\"messages\"\". Parents beware.\",pww142d-E7zf9dqBW0B3OA\\n10/11/2018,2.0,\"I have to say that the level of service from this office has changed greatly. I had to wait over 1 hour with my 1 year old. No apology.

The nurse just put needle after needle in my daughter without trying to distract her or do anything. Nurse had to take a lead test and prick my baby\\'s thumb and she wanted me to stop the bleeding after sticking her. Aren\\'t you the nurse?

If I would have known that there were no rapid flu tests I might have chosen to see a different doctor.I also figured that if my flu test came up negative the doctor would still want to see if I was sick, and maybe suggest another test or medication. Instead they called me, told me I didn\\'t have the flu and then literally hung up the phone. Definitely a little frustrating, especially given that I still felt sick and did not know what was wrong.Despite some snafus, the doctor is very sweet and knowledgable and the location of the office can\\'t be beat.

Due to raving reviews on parent Facebook groups we registered with this practice. We\\'ve been there twice and not planning on returning. 1. Similar to other reviews, the practice expects you to go check your lab results yourself online - don\\'t expect a phone call or explanations. Happened for both visits. Oh, also it took me 2 phone calls, multiple emails and an in-person-visit to get a printout of the code to actually setup the online account.2. First time was an emergency visit with high fever - with Dr. Santos and a male nurse. I appreciated the last-minute-appointment and both were nice and great with my kid. 3. Second time was our 18 month check-up, with Dr. Sharma, and a female nurse. This was a total disaster. First my kid got attacked and shoved to the floor by an angry 6 or 7-year old in the waiting room. Not the practice\\'s fault, I realize that, but also no asking by staff whether my daughter was ok (which she was, but rattled). Then 45 min waiting. Then the nurse snapped at my daughter when she cried during the vital measurements (\"\"come on, I\\'m only measuring your head\"\"). My daughter is usually very good-natured, but does not like unknown people touching her. Obviously, at 18 months old, she can not rationalize a doctor visit. Then Dr. Sharma came in, and, how can I put this politely, was really unfriendly and condescending both with my kid and myself. I honestly do not understand the good reviews. Don\\'t tell my daughter \"\"at your 2-year-visit, you better talk!\"\". Don\\'t tell her she is \"\"fake\"\" when she cries because you are examining her. Don\\'t tell me \"\"I\\'ll better take your word for it\"\" when I say she is talking plenty at home (did I mention the being rattled and crying?). But the most \"\"fun\"\" part was the blood draw the nurse did. As she remarked, my daughter is \"\"a bleeder\"\", so her finger kept bleeding a lot and for a long time. Nurse just left us there sitting with bloody gauzes on the examination table, with one band-aid on my daughter\\'s finger, which was bled through in seconds and came off. Had to go through drawers for more gauze to stop the bleeding and more bandaids. Nobody saw us out. A month later I call (again) to get the blood results, to learn they are posted on healow - but beware, not under lab results, where I had been looking, but under \"\"messages\"\".

I\\'ve always wanted to write a recommendation for her, but I felt I couldn\\'t find words great enough to convey how amazing she is. But now I really must try, because I literally owe her my life.  7 years ago, Dr. Keil had me get an x-ray for a cough. It revealed a spot on my lung, and Dr. Keil wrote a referral for a CT scan. I went to a renown cancer-treatment center. The oncologist followed me yearly from 2012-2014. Each year I had a CT scan, and the spot had not grown. In 2015 when I returned for my appointment, the oncologist said that she did not see a need for a CT scan, as the spot had not progressed in all that time. I assumed I was fine. The oncologist never called to tell me to get another scan. Dr. Keil convinced me to return for another scan, regardless. This time, the spot had grown. It was biopsied, and tested positive for cancer. I had a lobe of my lung removed, and am now cancer-free. If Dr. Keil hadn\\'t been so proactive, my cancer most likely would not have been discovered until it reached an incurable stage.    Dr. Keil is an authentically warm, kind and compassionate person. She is an exceptionally knowledgeable, insightful, and patient physician. There are so many examples I could cite of how wonderful a doctor she is, but for the sake of concision I will mention just one more. Earlier this summer I had symptoms of a urinary track infection. I live on Long Island, and because it began on a weekend and frankly, because I was being lazy, I went to a local urgent care center thinking I could get an antibiotic, and that would be that. I did get an antibiotic, but my infection became worse. On Tuesday I returned to the urgent care center, where they took another urine sample and prescribed a different antibiotic. By Thursday I had a 103.5 fever and every part of my body ached. I finally called Dr. Keil and told her my symptoms. She said it sounded like a kidney infection, and said I should come see her the next day. I agreed, although I couldn\\'t imagine how I was going to get myself there. Dr. Keil called in a prescription which I took that night, and by the next morning my fever was gone with just about all of the accompanying symptoms. I had been prescribed the wrong prescription (twice) from urgent care and might have required hospitalization or worse, had I not had Dr. Keil to turn to.  So I was right, I don\\'t have the words to adequately express how lucky I am to have Dr. Keil as my physician. But if you want the best care possible, make an appointment with her and see for yourself.\",HwbUlkSH3r5ArHzNDj84Ng\\n8/7/2018,5.0,\"I have a literal phobia of doctors. Dr. Keil is the only doctor who has ever made me feel safe and like my health matters to her.

She makes you feel heard and makes sure to really note down all of your symptoms. She then checks in with you about anything you might have mentioned in later appointments. She really does the utmost best to make you feel like you are being taken care of. She is an incredible doctor and also has amazing judgment in any medication she\\'s given me (as in, they\\'ve been spot on and really helped me.) So big thank you to Dr. Keil for being the best ever! I LOVE HER!\",HwbUlkSH3r5ArHzNDj84Ng\\n10/28/2016,5.0,\"Adding to all the 5-star reviews, it\\'s amazing to finally have a doctor who actually listens and makes time for her patients. Dr. Keil is thorough, empathetic, smart, and attentive. She is also great about following up and making sure her patients are taken care of. I\\'m so glad I found her and highly recommend her to anyone looking for a great family practitioner.\",HwbUlkSH3r5ArHzNDj84Ng\\n8/18/2017,1.0,I really have no idea how she is as a doctor because she\\'s apparently not accepting new patients. Rating is result of unbelievably rude receptionist who lies about returning phone messages.,HwbUlkSH3r5ArHzNDj84Ng\\n1/21/2013,4.0,\"I\\'ve been going to Dr. Keil for about 8 years now and she\\'s always nice and consistent. The office is easily accessible and the receptionists have been there for a long time ( well, at least Jessie). It\\'s usually easy to get an emergency appointment, but if you need to do a regular visit, it\\'s crazy because she\\'s usually booked for months. Other than that, she has a great bedside manner and seems really concerned about your well being. The only thing that might be annoying is that she does always refer you to someone else for every little thing, but I guess that\\'s just being safe. Most times the problem fades away by the time your appointment for the second person comes around. I would still recommend her though, she\\'s still a great doctor.\",HwbUlkSH3r5ArHzNDj84Ng\\n10/16/2014,5.0,\"Love her. My husband and I have been patients for about 10 yrs. Dr. Keil is consistently kind, caring and thorough. She calls to see how you are when not feeling great and offers lots of reassurance when you\\'re needlessly worried. I really appreciate having her in our lives. Dr. Keil has no arrogance or ego. If you think something doesn\\'t feel right and explain your feelings to her, she is very willing to reassess and change course. This is SO important. She is also a fan of acupuncture and other complementary medicines to work along with her. She only wants the best for you, her patient, and that shines through. Additionally, she uses her gut. She will say to you, \"\"My gut is telling me this is gonna be ok,\"\" and that is invaluable. Because I know she has seen a lot of scary things. And her experience and intuition is worth it\\'s weight in gold.\",HwbUlkSH3r5ArHzNDj84Ng\\n1/1/2014,5.0,\"My husband and I have been patients of Dr. Keil for about 17 years. We have always felt comfortable discussing our private health matters--both physiological and psychological--as well as our personal lives, jobs, kids, travel, and even knitting. I entered the health care field a few years ago, and have spent enough time with doctors to know for certain what I have always felt about Dr. Keil: She is an exemplary general practitioner who listens to her patients, not only to form a diagnosis, but also to have a better understanding of the type of treatment they would be most comfortable with. She offers alternative treatment ideas and asks you what you would like to do. She doesn\\'t just start writing a script without telling you about the medication and asking you if you would like to try it. Seems like common sense, doesn\\'t it? Unlike most doctors, she follows up with lab results by phone.Dr. Kiel and her partner, Jeanne Travis, MD, who is also excellent, do something that my husband and I have never seen in any other healthcare setting. They come out to the waiting room themselves to greet you, where they shake your hand. And they\\'re not wearing gloves.\",HwbUlkSH3r5ArHzNDj84Ng\\n12/10/2012,5.0,\"Dr. Keil is a very special doctor. In addition to being experienced and knowledgeable, she is warm, patient, and a fantastic listener. I always feel so comfortable in appointments, and never rushed.

Not too sure about the new office, since I have not been yet, the staff seems friendly but over the phone is a bit tough to navigate. Still on 14th, but the new address has not been changed on Yelp.\",HwbUlkSH3r5ArHzNDj84Ng\\n9/11/2013,4.0,\"Dr. Keil has now been my doctor for about 3 years. I like that she is straight to the point, gives very simple explanation to any of my concerns and is very knowledgeable. She is warm and easy to talk to; I never hesitate to talk to her very openly, whenever I have a concern. I think establishing a relationship or feeling comfortable with your PCP is very important and Dr. Keil is great at it, I highly recommend her.\",HwbUlkSH3r5ArHzNDj84Ng\\n10/17/2013,5.0,\"Dr. Keil has been my primary care doctor since I moved to NYC in 1996.

She takes the time to listen to your questions and concerns and then answer them the best she can. I\\'ve been a patient of hers for 7 years and always find her to be friendly and communicative.Give yourself time when scheduling a general appointment, but if you have any immediate issue, the office will fit you in as soon as they can.\",HwbUlkSH3r5ArHzNDj84Ng\\n8/29/2010,5.0,\"She\\'s been my doctor for the past four years now, despite living all the way uptown. Dr. Keil is thorough and a great listener.  She gives good recommendations of specialists and is very prompt with communicating results.Sometimes the office staff can be a bit curt, but it\\'s a busy office. Most of the time they are quite pleasant and accommodating. Be prepared to wait about a month for routine appointments.4/11/12 updated to add: There is a reason I still schlep down to 14th street from the 140\\'s! I\\'ve had a respiratory issue develop in the last few days and Dr Keil called to check on me later the same day I saw her!

I like that her office seems down home and she seems invested in her patients. My appointment with her was quick, but she answered my questions and walked me through next steps. I felt like she was smart and competent, and that she was keen to find the reason behind my health problems.\",HwbUlkSH3r5ArHzNDj84Ng\\n10/14/2015,5.0,\"There\\'s lots to be said about the health care system in the US... Seeing a doctor should not cost you an arm and a leg nor should receiving appropriate treatment. This is a basic human right and it should not be reserved for the rich. Rant of an ex Aussie over... Dr Gandhi is indeed an amazing primary care doctor. Not only will he take the time to listen to your ailments but obtains an extensive knowledge of your history in order to recommend the best outcomes being mindful of costs and degree of necessity. He also gave me a follow up call a few hours after my appointment after writing his notes on my case in order to reiterate what next steps I should take.TO NOTE!I made an appointment at the doctor for 1:30pm and was seen 2hrs after so I recommend just calling to confirm the time he can see you before actually making the journey down. Also this is cash only so come prepared with your $90 in hand. I would HIGHLY recommend Dr Gandhi.

Dr. Berk is a good doctor and knows his stuff but he\\'s more of a businessman than a doctor. If your a first timer- one of the documents he makes you MUST sign is a form stating your responsibility for all FINAL costs. Sure enough when I checked my claim online, I was charged a \"\"first time office visit\"\" fee of $350 ( I had to pay out of pocket).Make sure to read over all the documents he gives you, and definitely make sure they are billing your insurance company for actual procedures performed.The nurses are disgruntled and easily annoyed.

He seemed to barely tolerate my admittedly ignorant questions. He seemed very impatient with me, which is aggravating and stressful when you\\'re feeling scared about your health. During our communications on their online messaging service, he would share news with me like \"\"the tests were negative for X and Y\"\", but then not follow up with \"\"and here\\'s what we should do next.\"\" It was always me disparately trying to find clarification of his minimal notes.

He\\'s committed to excellence and truly cares about keeping his clients healthy and well. He provides an electronic newsletter.

I showed up a few minutes early and politely asked if he was running to schedule since I was meeting someone at 7:30 (appt. at 6:30). I was told yes, that I was next. 20 minutes later, I still had yet to be seen. I asked--again, politely--if they maybe knew what his schedule was like, and was given a very rude, very nonchalant answer from the nurse who had previously taken my blood pressure. The receptionist seemed to be taken aback by my question, at which point the nurse stepped in. Instead of apologizing, and telling me they understand, she was curt, short, and downright rude. I went back to my room, the door slammed behind me (I even re-opened and apologized so they would know it wasn\\'t some intentional, bratty thing!) and from there it only got more disappointing.5 minutes later, Dr. Berk comes in and the nurses had clearly informed him of my \"\"pestering.\"\" He barely took the time to introduce himself and immediately got down to business. Perhaps this was because they told him I was hurried, but his bedside manner was not welcoming. I felt as if he was annoyed I was even there. He warmed up during the appointment but I felt he wasn\\'t taking my concerns seriously, and just trying to hurry. Again, I would have appreciated this if it was because he was concerned about my timing, but he too didn\\'t apologize for being 30 minutes late to see me, nor did I feel as if he was doing this out of kindness. He clearly just wanted to be done with my appointment. I felt as if he was ignoring certain things I said, and wasn\\'t as in depth as I prefer doctors to be. Even if he could have recommended another doctor, that would have been SOMEthing. Then, as he was leaving he passively said to me \"\"well, I heard you have somewhere to be...\"\" How rude is that! I left with a bad taste in my mouth about the whole practice. I apologized again to the nurses about the door slamming, yet they ignored me. Hoping I don\\'t have to go back to this practice again.\",Ch-EDzx-aDlWvHUItJUj1g\\n8/5/2015,5.0,I have no complaints with Dr. Berk and Rachael his nurse practitioner.

He mentioned that it might be allergies (even though I\\'m not allergic to anything) and although I mentioned I didn\\'t have heartburn or feel any acid reflux, he said that\\'s what it was. It wasn\\'t until 3 weeks later at my son\\'s pediatrician that I was tested for Pertussis (whopping cough) as she was alarmed that I was coughing/gagging the way I was. I am visiting a pulmonologist to take some tests for Bronchitis/Pneumonia this week, but I just wanted to post that I was VERY disappointed that these ailments weren\\'t even a consideration when I went to see Dr. Berk.

I called back Dr.Berk\\'s office back and left a message with his staff who returned my call with no helpful follow up information. After another call to his office and email I finally got a short email from Dr. Berk saying there was nothing he could do or suggest: my insurance wouldn\\'t cover the visits. Before I left that first visit he did give me a test for something I didn\\'t originally want as I was pretty sure I had already had thyroids tested. I agreed at the moment as he seemed to think it was important--maybe to make me feel like I hadn\\'t totally wasted my time.

I made my decision based on Yelp reviews after ZocDocs reviews lead me astray on my last doctor\\'s visit. Yelpers are the best!Dr. Berk\\'s staff was super helpful and even chipper, but not annoyingly so. The new patient forms weren\\'t unduly long and didn\\'t require me to sign over my first born child. There are computers set up in the spacious lobby where you enter your symptoms, which is nice because it gets rid of the prelude conversations that you normally repeat to 2 nurses, a physician\\'s assistant, and the doctor. I didn\\'t mind the computer system at all. The waiting area, as I said, was spacious. The light was nice, and there was a glug-glug with really cold water, which made this sickly gal quite happy. There was one girl waiting and one couple who came in after me who were seen before I was, and they seemed to go in and out quickly. I was called back (after paying my co-pay), and I talked to Mary, a sweet doctor\\'s assistant who I thought was very good. She did all of the temp taking, etc.... Within 5 pages of my book of her leaving, Dr. Berk appeared. Dr. Berk is the kind of doctor you imagine when you are little. The kind of doctor you envision you will have after the mean pediatrician who gives you shots flees the scene. He is kind, inquisitive, is aware you are sick and don\\'t want to talk a bunch, and had great information about why I was sick, the neighborhood, and how I was going to get well. He did not rush me, and I felt like I could ask as many questions as needed. He rides his bike to work. Need I say more?! He\\'s like Mr. Rogers but not creepy. With the paperwork, the computer quiz about my illness, a little bit of waiting, and my actual visit, it took 45 minutes, which I think is fantastic.

I did not ask to be seen; I asked for the doctor to OK the prescription which clearly does not require him to see me, when asked if the doctor is in she did not answer instead she said he\\'s not seeing patients today. I\\'ll leave it there. Currently looking for a more personable PCP/PCP office. After all, it is my health.\",Ch-EDzx-aDlWvHUItJUj1g\\n9/21/2014,1.0,\"the review by MK is dead accurate in regards this office but I would like to add my 2 cents. Dr. Berk is a good doctor and knows his stuff but he\\'s more of a businessman than a doctor. If your a first timer- one of the documents he makes you MUST sign is a form stating your responsibility for all FINAL costs. Sure enough when I checked my claim online, I was charged a \"\"first time office visit\"\" fee of $350 ( I had to pay out of pocket).Make sure to read over all the documents he gives you, and definitely make sure they are billing your insurance company for actual procedures performed.The nurses are disgruntled and easily annoyed. My nurse wasnt gentle when drawing blood. She\\'s Lucky I\\'m a big boy.Read the review by MK... I agree with everything he said.\",Ch-EDzx-aDlWvHUItJUj1g\\n2/1/2016,2.0,\"Seeing Dr. Berk these past few weeks has been a consistently disappointing and frustrating experience that always leaves me wanting more. He seemed to barely tolerate my admittedly ignorant questions. He seemed very impatient with me, which is aggravating and stressful when you\\'re feeling scared about your health. During our communications on their online messaging service, he would share news with me like \"\"the tests were negative for X and Y\"\", but then not follow up with \"\"and here\\'s what we should do next.\"\" It was always me disparately trying to find clarification of his minimal notes. I will never go back to Dr. Berk. I\\'m sure he is an extremely knowledgable doctor, but he\\'s terrible at giving care. Please be weary.\",Ch-EDzx-aDlWvHUItJUj1g\\n1/10/2015,5.0,\"Dr Berk is a fantastic physician. I have been going here for about ten years and have seen Dr Berk from everything from routine check ups, flu shots, vaccinations and appointment needs prior to out of country travel. He\\'s very thorough and knowledgeable. He listens and provides vital patient education. He offers useful referrals out where applicable. I feel I receive prompt attention and quality care. He\\'s committed to excellence and truly cares about keeping his clients healthy and well. He provides an electronic newsletter. It\\'s great to see he was an earlier adopter of technology to help his clients in his practice. He makes scheduling easy. He started many years ago giving clients access to their electronic medical records which is helpful. Dr Berk and his staff are great and very accommodating.\",Ch-EDzx-aDlWvHUItJUj1g\\n11/2/2013,5.0,\"Dr. Berk\\'s office has come to my rescue several times. Not that I\\'ve had anything serious to deal with, but the occasional aches and pains of a body about to enter its fourth decade need some attention occasionally. I\\'ve found Dr. Berk to be pleasant and direct. But also willing to answer in-depth questions if asked.His practice also offers low-income options, which I appreciate. And the staff is always courteous and congenial.\",Ch-EDzx-aDlWvHUItJUj1g\\n4/1/2015,5.0,\"The next my visit to this doctor was awesome. The best atmosphere I have even seen, the doctor was very accurate and very polite.

He\\'s been able to see both myself and my husband quickly when we\\'re sick, and every visit he\\'s calm, competent, knowledgeable, and perhaps most importantly, caring. He actually listens and I\\'ve never felt rushed.Recently I\\'ve dealt with a persistent case of strep throat, and while it\\'s been incredibly frustrating, he\\'s managed my care really well, even calling another one of my Doctors to make sure I was ok to take a particular medicine. (I feel like no doctor does that these days -- most times it\\'s up to me to liaise between doctors, which can be overwhelming.)I also love the online tool his office uses -- you can email him questions (I\\'ve always gotten prompt responses) and look up your medical records. All Doctor\\'s offices should have this these days, super helpful.I\\'m grateful to have found such a great Doctor so close by.\",Ch-EDzx-aDlWvHUItJUj1g\\n3/28/2014,5.0,\"This morning was my first time at Dr.Berk\\'s office. I met with Rachael Geyer, a Nurse Practitioner. She was amazing! So genuine and thorough. She listened to my concerns and answered all my questions. I could tell she was giving me her undivided attention, which I don\\'t typically experience at busy doctors\\' offices. I haven\\'t met Dr. Berk yet, but I can highly recommend his Nurse Practitioner, Rachael. Also, the front office staff was very welcoming and helpful. :) NOTE: The listed address is incorrect. The office is on the 3rd floor, not 6th.\",Ch-EDzx-aDlWvHUItJUj1g\\n7/31/2015,2.0,\"I have faith that Dr. Berk is a knowledgeable man, I\\'ve had a number of people in the area recommend him but my personal experience with his office left me extremely disappointed, and feeling as if I didn\\'t get the care I deserved. I showed up a few minutes early and politely asked if he was running to schedule since I was meeting someone at 7:30 (appt. at 6:30). I was told yes, that I was next. 20 minutes later, I still had yet to be seen. I asked--again, politely--if they maybe knew what his schedule was like, and was given a very rude, very nonchalant answer from the nurse who had previously taken my blood pressure. The receptionist seemed to be taken aback by my question, at which point the nurse stepped in. Instead of apologizing, and telling me they understand, she was curt, short, and downright rude. I went back to my room, the door slammed behind me (I even re-opened and apologized so they would know it wasn\\'t some intentional, bratty thing!) and from there it only got more disappointing.5 minutes later, Dr. Berk comes in and the nurses had clearly informed him of my \"\"pestering.\"\" He barely took the time to introduce himself and immediately got down to business. Perhaps this was because they told him I was hurried, but his bedside manner was not welcoming. I felt as if he was annoyed I was even there. He warmed up during the appointment but I felt he wasn\\'t taking my concerns seriously, and just trying to hurry. Again, I would have appreciated this if it was because he was concerned about my timing, but he too didn\\'t apologize for being 30 minutes late to see me, nor did I feel as if he was doing this out of kindness. He clearly just wanted to be done with my appointment. I felt as if he was ignoring certain things I said, and wasn\\'t as in depth as I prefer doctors to be. Even if he could have recommended another doctor, that would have been SOMEthing. Then, as he was leaving he passively said to me \"\"well, I heard you have somewhere to be...\"\" How rude is that! I left with a bad taste in my mouth about the whole practice. I apologized again to the nurses about the door slamming, yet they ignored me. Hoping I don\\'t have to go back to this practice again.\",Ch-EDzx-aDlWvHUItJUj1g\\n8/5/2015,5.0,I have no complaints with Dr. Berk and Rachael his nurse practitioner. They both create a calm and professional environment. I have recommended family and friends to Dr. Berk. I cannot thank them enough.,Ch-EDzx-aDlWvHUItJUj1g\\n8/15/2012,1.0,\"I went to Dr. Berk with a chronic cough that I had had for 4 months (am also pregnant), he told me it was acid reflux and that was that. He mentioned that it might be allergies (even though I\\'m not allergic to anything) and although I mentioned I didn\\'t have heartburn or feel any acid reflux, he said that\\'s what it was. It wasn\\'t until 3 weeks later at my son\\'s pediatrician that I was tested for Pertussis (whopping cough) as she was alarmed that I was coughing/gagging the way I was. I am visiting a pulmonologist to take some tests for Bronchitis/Pneumonia this week, but I just wanted to post that I was VERY disappointed that these ailments weren\\'t even a consideration when I went to see Dr. Berk. Moral? Trust your gut when you think the diagnosis isn\\'t right and go to another doctor.\",Ch-EDzx-aDlWvHUItJUj1g\\n3/20/2013,1.0,\"Spent 20 minutes filling out new patient forms only to spend most of my visit answering the same questions. He told me he was uncomfortable diagnosing me, suggested that I call a colleague of his, which I did after leaving, and the other doctor had no idea why Dr. Berk would have suggested his name. I called back Dr.Berk\\'s office back and left a message with his staff who returned my call with no helpful follow up information. After another call to his office and email I finally got a short email from Dr. Berk saying there was nothing he could do or suggest: my insurance wouldn\\'t cover the visits. Before I left that first visit he did give me a test for something I didn\\'t originally want as I was pretty sure I had already had thyroids tested. I agreed at the moment as he seemed to think it was important--maybe to make me feel like I hadn\\'t totally wasted my time. Luckily that was something the insurance did partially cover.\",Ch-EDzx-aDlWvHUItJUj1g\\n10/19/2009,5.0,\"I love Dr. Berk! I happen to find him as I was looking for a site that allowed you to make appointments online. The entire staff is really nice and really caring. Before I go, I fill out a questionnaire describing what I\\'m going in for.The wait time has never been long for me and I usually arrive a few minutes early. The office is comfortable and Dr. Berk is ALWAYS concerned and helpful. He spends the time necessary to explain everything and really cares about every patient!\",Ch-EDzx-aDlWvHUItJUj1g\\n9/30/2010,5.0,\"I can\\'t believe I found a doctor as great as Dr. Berk so easily. I made my decision based on Yelp reviews after ZocDocs reviews lead me astray on my last doctor\\'s visit. Yelpers are the best!Dr. Berk\\'s staff was super helpful and even chipper, but not annoyingly so. The new patient forms weren\\'t unduly long and didn\\'t require me to sign over my first born child. There are computers set up in the spacious lobby where you enter your symptoms, which is nice because it gets rid of the prelude conversations that you normally repeat to 2 nurses, a physician\\'s assistant, and the doctor. I didn\\'t mind the computer system at all. The waiting area, as I said, was spacious. The light was nice, and there was a glug-glug with really cold water, which made this sickly gal quite happy. There was one girl waiting and one couple who came in after me who were seen before I was, and they seemed to go in and out quickly. I was called back (after paying my co-pay), and I talked to Mary, a sweet doctor\\'s assistant who I thought was very good. She did all of the temp taking, etc.... Within 5 pages of my book of her leaving, Dr. Berk appeared. Dr. Berk is the kind of doctor you imagine when you are little. The kind of doctor you envision you will have after the mean pediatrician who gives you shots flees the scene. He is kind, inquisitive, is aware you are sick and don\\'t want to talk a bunch, and had great information about why I was sick, the neighborhood, and how I was going to get well. He did not rush me, and I felt like I could ask as many questions as needed. He rides his bike to work. Need I say more?! He\\'s like Mr. Rogers but not creepy. With the paperwork, the computer quiz about my illness, a little bit of waiting, and my actual visit, it took 45 minutes, which I think is fantastic. The office is conveniently located to just about any subway line you could want, so I suggest you hustle over and see Dr. Charles Berk if you\\'re feeling under the weather.\",Ch-EDzx-aDlWvHUItJUj1g\\n3/18/2014,5.0,\"Dr. Leonard is the best doctor in NYC, and I say this after having tried several others. He is not only brilliant as a practitioner, but he listens and is kind. Dr. Leonard is the first (and only) doctor to really make me feel human - Dr\\'s (especially in the tri-state area, I\\'m from CT) always seem like they\\'re in robot mode and I\\'ve questioned the intelligence of most. Dr. Leonard is different - he get\\'s to the bottom of what\\'s going on with your health to make sure that you are treated in the best manner possible. His office of nurses and admin\\'s are also top notch. They work very closely to ensure that you understand your own insurance and policies. They are experts in explaining what your HR Department/Insurance provider typically fails to communicate. With this office - there are never any surprises. Dr. Leonard was recommend to me by a former co-worker who couldn\\'t say more positive things. I have gone on to recommend him to 2 other colleagues and they have gone out of their way to tell me just how wonderful he is. To give you an example: I work in Chelsea and live very far away from Yorkville, but he is the only Dr. that I will go to. This goes the same for my colleagues who live in Hoboken, Park Slope, and Long Island City. He is worth it.\",X-TmWQinrfZ7cmvzJwPqUg\\n9/26/2017,2.0,\"Don\\'t let the positive reviews here fool you. Pay very close attention to Jeffery Y\\'s review, specifically regarding his interactions with Dr. Leonard\\'s secretary, Xiomora (I believe that\\'s how you spell it). I have nothing positive to say about her. She\\'s curt, baselessly condescending, unreasonable, devoid of compassion, refuses to listen to anyone but herself and, consistently miscommunicates with both patient and her employer, Dr. Leonard. For instance, I received a VM from Dr. Leonard in regards to some test results and, when I listened to it, gave him a call back to discuss some findings he voiced that were alarming to me. Long story short, his secretary simply did not want to let me talk to Dr. Leonard, but rather stated he needed additional test results before we could even chat. I\\'m not sure how Dr. Leonard gives her the authority to make such a decision, especially without a medical degree. Seems shortsighted and negligent. Further, when a patient is concerned about their test results a doctor has not directly communicated to him/her, it\\'s a doctor\\'s obligation to have a conversation with his/her patient at the patient\\'s request. A degree of compassion is necessary in the medical field. Thankfully the doctor did eventually call me back, but only after my fiancé called the office after me expressing to Xiomora how concerned I was about Dr. Leonard\\'s VM. I was more at ease after talking with Dr. Leonard, but that was short-lived when I found a notable discrepancy between what the doctor and I discussed and what I read in my radiology report the very next day. The discrepancy was significant and, again, alarming. Leonard said I had one thing, and the report said I had something very different. Consequently, I called his office once again to inquire about the discrepancy. A nurse picked up, listened to my concern, and immediately stated the doctor would call me back. Moments later, however, I received a call from Xiomora. She was abrasive in tone, combative and outright condescending. At no point did she even listen to me as I explained my reason for calling. Instead, she kept reiterating that the doctor could not speak to me because he had already done so the day prior. Further, if I wanted to speak to him, I\\'d have to make an appointment. Frustrated, I pointed out the discrepancy to her in detail. At that point, she finally put me on hold and went to go speak to Dr. Leonard.Now for Dr. Leonard. When I came off hold, he was on the other end. Right out of the gate, in a frustrated and rude tone, he began reprimanding me for calling. During his rant, he reiterated most of what his secretary had said, specifically about having already spoken to me. Clearly, Xiomora didn\\'t provide him the correct information in regards to why I was calling again. When I pointed out my reasoning for calling again, Dr. Leonard calmed a bit, and stated his secretary told him something very different. According to him, his secretary said that I was calling to complain, ranting that he had not called me back the day prior. Clearly this was not the case, nor my reason for calling that day. In a still frustrated state, however, he blurted out that he lied about my test results as he \"\"didn\\'t want to freak me out.\"\" I get his perspective, but, candidly, it is not his decision to make. I had a test done, he got the results. It is his job to tell me what those results are, what they mean, and where to go from there. His approach leaves room for ambiguity, confusion and, logically, increases a patient\\'s anxiety. After a lengthy conversation that I must admit was productive, Dr. Leonard apologized for his actions and on behalf of his secretary. I appreciated that, but I moved on to another provider. I don\\'t need the drama and harassment in addition to my health concerns.Bottom line, he\\'s a good doctor and he knows his stuff. He does need to work on making himself available to his patients, controlling his temper, and being more considerate of other people\\'s emotions. Most importantly, however, he shouldn\\'t be lying to patients, irrespective of his reasoning. His secretary, on the other hand, I have no explanation nor excuses for. She is just outright cold and cannot communicate effectively with either her boss or his patients and, as a result, cannot serve as a medium between a doctor and his patients. Coming from a client-service based industry, I\\'m not even sure how she is allowed to be customer-facing in any capacity.\",X-TmWQinrfZ7cmvzJwPqUg\\n5/11/2017,5.0,I visited Dr. Leonard this morning and I must say that he is by far the best doctor I\\'ve ever been to. He is extremely thorough. He took the time to answer all of my crazy questions. He is really cares about the health of his patients. He is officially my new PCP. You can\\'t go wrong with him.,X-TmWQinrfZ7cmvzJwPqUg\\n7/31/2016,3.0,\"Dr. Leonard is an excellent internist -- but only when you\\'re in his office. He has the most insensitive, inhumane secretary I have ever dealt with in a medical practice. I reported this to dr. Leonard a year ago, and he confirmed that he had had multiple complaints about her. Despite this, he still has not replaced her. It is also my observation that he now has too many patients to handle adequately, not enough support staff, and will no longer return phone calls -- regardless of the issue. Recent example: A couple of weeks ago I called the office around 12 noon and asked to speak to Dr. Leonard anytime that day or night with an urgent medical issue regarding my heart. I explained to Secretary Ratched (see \"\"Cuckoo\\'s Nest\"\") that I was dizzy and my heart rate was very slow -- and needed to ask Dr. L if I should go to the ER, or make an appt to see him quickly. Instead of receiving a call from HIM, the same secretary called me back in a few hours. She said that Dr. L\\'s advice was that he could see me the next day, but \"\"if the symptoms get worse, go to the ER.\"\" I asked her how bad they had to be to go the ER. She said I\\'d have to figure that out myself, and Dr. L didn\\'t have time to call that day or night to ask about them.  In desperation, I called the Empire BCBS Medical Help Line. After asking me 10 minutes of questions about my symptoms, the nurse practitioner told me that I should go to the ER \"\"within one hour\"\", according to Empire\\'s guidelines. I feel that Dr. L\\'s ambiguous advice, and more importantly his failure to call me back, put my health in serious jeopardy.  As a Clinical Psychologist, I appreciate the vital importance of being available to patients in crisis. Dr. L and/or his office does not. As much respect as I have for Dr. L, I strongly recommend that you look elsewhere for an internist. I\\'m looking for another physician myself right now -- one who has the time to deal with patients when they have potential emergency issues.\",X-TmWQinrfZ7cmvzJwPqUg\\n9/1/2015,5.0,He is very personable and very thorough.

And pretty much every patient I\\'ve ever seen walk in there is Chinese / Asian so I guess we\\'re just not the kind of clientele they accept. Today, after throwing my back out so badly the prior evening that I was crying in pain as I walked very slowly down to lobby, holding on to the walls and a pilates roller I was using as a walking stick, hoping to make an appointment just to get a prescription of some kind (because my regular doctor couldn\\'t prescribe over the phone and I was unable to physically get there), they turned me away, despite my offering to pay cash or with my insurance. \"\"No new patients.\"\" I was/am in so much pain that I cannot make it any further than my lobby and she cold-heartedly couldn\\'t have cared less. I have a high deductible and the amount I would have to shell out for an ER / Urgent Care visit or ambulance ride is just not feasible. Any doctor who can turn away a suffering (not to mention PAYING) patient who just needs five minutes and possibly an Rx of some kind away without so much as a referral or offer to have office staff walk you back to the elevator is not only a horrible doctor, but a horrible person. I wouldn\\'t be surprised if she let someone drop dead in front of her office if they weren\\'t already already a patient. Did they even cover the Hippocratic oath at the second-rate medical school she attended upstate? If you\\'re reading this review and you\\'re not already a patient, don\\'t bother, she doesn\\'t want your business anyway.

However, what I love the most is her desire to educate me about my health along the way. She takes a lot of time to explain things...even seemingly basic things...to make sure I understand what is going on in my own body. I have found it both fascinating and empowering. I\\'ve never known another Dr to be so proactive in educating her patients about their own health and wellness. Dr. Kroner is confident in her abilities to help you without coming across as pompous or condescending, and it very much makes me confident in her abilities as well. She has also been happy to help me in other areas of my health by recommending everything from an OB/GYN to an opthamologist.

Never once did anyone from the billing department (certainly not Jennifer herself who runs it) try to contact me saying I had an outstanding balance.

I paid the balance immediately but am incredibly disillusioned that my loyal patronage for almost 5 years has meant nothing.Overall, the doctors are great but you can find great doctors anywhere in NYC.

Which it did, so we did.We left after this horrid treatment and rushed to NYU Langone Medical Center at Trinity and we were immediately seen even though she was a new patient. The staff at NYU Langone were horrified when they heard my daughter was turned away from her practice given the state she was in. The literally looked sick and apologized on behalf of the other practice, saddened that they could do this to an infant. I turned out my daughter had a UTI that had gone missed at the first appt I took her to Weil Cornell for when the low grade fever and irritability began. This infection went on much longer than anyone should endure, particularly a 7.5 month old.I can\\'t express to you the fear and anger of having people tell you they won\\'t see your infant child, as she shakes and is clearly very ill. It was the most cold-hearted, irresponsible and unkind treatment of an infant I ever witnessed first hand. I won\\'t forget how this felt. I won\\'t forget how helpless we were and how cold they were to us. It was so disturbing. Weill Cornell had made a few mistakes before (confusing the date on a well visit and their after-hour phones not working, making it impossible to reach anyone who was on call) and I let it go as these were not serious mistakes, just inconveniences. I was super understanding bc we all make mistakes. But this situation was beyond. This practice should be ashamed of themselves.

The only reason why we chose her to begin with is because my babies spent some time at Cornell\\'s nicu and she had been a resident there. We figured because she had that experience she would understand their situation and know that they are extra sensitive given they were very early preemies. First off, it is VERY difficult to get in touch with her. My daughter ran a fever for 4 days and every day I called them, the nurse practitioner, jessica just sounded annoyed and told me to just \"\"watch her, and give her tylenol\"\". On the 4th day of my daughter turning maroon, shaking and whimpering, they finally decided to see her. When we got to the office, they wanted to do a urine test to see if it was a UTI. Dr. Wasserman and her team did not seem to know how to put a catheter in her, it took forever, and my daughter was suffering through the whole process. But the worst part was, my daughter\\'s heart rate was through the roof so we had to call 911 from her office and we took an ambulance to the ER. Turns out the UTI got so bad she became septic. We ended up spending a HORRIBLE, heart breaking, 7 days in the hospital. This could have probably been prevented if Wasserman saw her earlier but she just ignored all the signs. And the worst part of all of this is that she never called us ONCE to check up on us to see if we were okay - considering we had to call 911 from her office. She doesn\\'t seem to care about her patients.

Regardless, after an abnormal test result they contacted me and informed me I had to come in for a separate procedure. They prepared me that the procedure would take about 30mins but that I would be fine after. The procedure took about 10mins because once again Dr. Fong was rushing. Following both of these visits within a month, I received a bill from the office stating that they did NOT accept my insurance and that I owed them a total of $2300.... W T F.

I had gone to a clinic off Union Square and gotten some blood work, and was sent here for further analysis. The doctor I met with was lovely, but the way this company cheats money out of you in insane. I was used to not having insurance and asked the price before, and was prepared to pay in-office. Saw the doctor for 10 minutes, had more blood drawn, and he wanted me to have an ultrasound on the floor below. By the end of it I paid just $400. Steep, for what I had done, but worth it, of course, to know that everything was ok. So a few weeks go by, and I start getting bills. By the end of it I apparently owe them another $400. I assume it\\'s a mistake, seeing as I had already paid about that. I even checked my account to make sure it was taken out and am prepared to provide a fax of my bank statement. Only, when I finally talk to someone (after several phone calls and being passed around multiple people, of course) they tell me that when I was at the doctor\\'s office I only paid half of what I owed and this was the other half. I have multiple issues with this. I was not AT ALL informed of this beforehand or at the accounting desk, where I paid, which I\\'m sure is illegal.

The only reason why we chose her to begin with is because my babies spent some time at Cornell\\'s nicu and she had been a resident there. We figured because she had that experience she would understand their situation and know that they are extra sensitive given they were very early preemies. First off, it is VERY difficult to get in touch with her. My daughter ran a fever for 4 days and every day I called them, the nurse practitioner, jessica just sounded annoyed and told me to just \"\"watch her, and give her tylenol\"\". On the 4th day of my daughter turning maroon, shaking and whimpering, they finally decided to see her. When we got to the office, they wanted to do a urine test to see if it was a UTI. Dr. Wasserman and her team did not seem to know how to put a catheter in her, it took forever, and my daughter was suffering through the whole process. But the worst part was, my daughter\\'s heart rate was through the roof so we had to call 911 from her office and we took an ambulance to the ER. Turns out the UTI got so bad she became septic. We ended up spending a HORRIBLE, heart breaking, 7 days in the hospital. This could have probably been prevented if Wasserman saw her earlier but she just ignored all the signs. And the worst part of all of this is that she never called us ONCE to check up on us to see if we were okay - considering we had to call 911 from her office. She doesn\\'t seem to care about her patients. Shame on her and her NP for ignoring all the signs and putting my family through such a tough and scary experience even though she was well aware of our Nicu journey.\",0GBmtExs01SYE_zVDP7eyw\\n5/27/2015,5.0,I have never thought about writing a review for a primary Dr until today\\'s experience.

I made the appointment, confirmed that they accepted my insurance and provided them with a card upon arrival. I met with Dr. Fong for about 2 minutes total. She was in and out and spoke so fast I had to ask her to repeat herself numerous times. I have never had an appointment that quick in my entire life - especially a first appointment with a doctor. Regardless, after an abnormal test result they contacted me and informed me I had to come in for a separate procedure. They prepared me that the procedure would take about 30mins but that I would be fine after. The procedure took about 10mins because once again Dr. Fong was rushing. Following both of these visits within a month, I received a bill from the office stating that they did NOT accept my insurance and that I owed them a total of $2300.... W T F. What is the point of asking to see insurance cards, copying them, etc. PRIOR to appointments if you are not going to inform patients that their insurance is not covered? I had also checked with my insurance company and they had them covered and dropped them a few weeks before my first appointment. I am now currently in the appeal process for bills over 2grand for less than 15minutes of the doctor\\'s time. I also looked at the bills and they are charging for Specialty visits when my visits were Preventative.

I had an appointment in my last gyn office that lasted over two hours when the total time the doctor spent with me was less than 10 minutes! Not cool. So I was on a search for a doctor who is willing to explain everything to me and made me feel like she was willing to spend as much time as it takes to explain everything. I just recently visit at Dr. Fong\\'s office. I actually got into her office early and Dr. Fong saw me right away. It was pretty fast. AWESOME! I hate waiting forever at any doctor office. Dr. Fong was quite friendly, listened to me and was willing to explain what methods she was going to use to diagnose my problems.

I had gone to a clinic off Union Square and gotten some blood work, and was sent here for further analysis. The doctor I met with was lovely, but the way this company cheats money out of you in insane. I was used to not having insurance and asked the price before, and was prepared to pay in-office. Saw the doctor for 10 minutes, had more blood drawn, and he wanted me to have an ultrasound on the floor below. By the end of it I paid just $400. Steep, for what I had done, but worth it, of course, to know that everything was ok. So a few weeks go by, and I start getting bills. By the end of it I apparently owe them another $400. I assume it\\'s a mistake, seeing as I had already paid about that. I even checked my account to make sure it was taken out and am prepared to provide a fax of my bank statement. Only, when I finally talk to someone (after several phone calls and being passed around multiple people, of course) they tell me that when I was at the doctor\\'s office I only paid half of what I owed and this was the other half. I have multiple issues with this. I was not AT ALL informed of this beforehand or at the accounting desk, where I paid, which I\\'m sure is illegal. And never in my years have I heard of a visit, blood work, and an ultrasound amounting over $800. Absolutely insane. They tell me the expense is from the transfer of my blood to the lab. Uhmmm this kid must drive it there in a farrari if that\\'s how much he gets paid to move some blood. They are so so full of shit and at this point stop communicating with me. Mind you, i am not an irritable person to deal with on the phone. I know that most of the time people are just doing their job and it\\'s the system that\\'s the problem. But for whatever reason, the woman I\\'m in contact with tells me she\\'s going to talk to her bosses and call me back and then never does. I leave several voicemails and nothing. Until a couple of months later when I get a call from a debt collector, of course. I finally just paid it, now almost 2 years after the visit.

I had to resort to emailing them through Weil Connect and FINALLY got a very curt and nasty message from her nurse not giving me any information and saying I had to wait for results.By Saturday morning and still no word I ended up going to the ER and I was given an ultrasound right away that showed I had a cyst that leaked fluid into my abdomen and fibroid. I have now found another better doctor with a much more professional and caring staff. This whole situation caused me a ton of anxiety and mental anguish not knowing what was wrong. Be careful going to this practice.\",0GBmtExs01SYE_zVDP7eyw\\n4/2/2017,1.0,\"One of my biggest regrets was that I chose Dr. Wasserman for my twins\\' first pediatrician. The only reason why we chose her to begin with is because my babies spent some time at Cornell\\'s nicu and she had been a resident there. We figured because she had that experience she would understand their situation and know that they are extra sensitive given they were very early preemies. First off, it is VERY difficult to get in touch with her. My daughter ran a fever for 4 days and every day I called them, the nurse practitioner, jessica just sounded annoyed and told me to just \"\"watch her, and give her tylenol\"\". On the 4th day of my daughter turning maroon, shaking and whimpering, they finally decided to see her. When we got to the office, they wanted to do a urine test to see if it was a UTI. Dr. Wasserman and her team did not seem to know how to put a catheter in her, it took forever, and my daughter was suffering through the whole process. But the worst part was, my daughter\\'s heart rate was through the roof so we had to call 911 from her office and we took an ambulance to the ER. Turns out the UTI got so bad she became septic. We ended up spending a HORRIBLE, heart breaking, 7 days in the hospital. This could have probably been prevented if Wasserman saw her earlier but she just ignored all the signs. And the worst part of all of this is that she never called us ONCE to check up on us to see if we were okay - considering we had to call 911 from her office. She doesn\\'t seem to care about her patients. Shame on her and her NP for ignoring all the signs and putting my family through such a tough and scary experience even though she was well aware of our Nicu journey.\",0GBmtExs01SYE_zVDP7eyw\\n5/27/2015,5.0,I have never thought about writing a review for a primary Dr until today\\'s experience. I was referred to Dr Ford through a friend and I couldn\\'t be happier!!1) Dr Ford was on time. I\\'ve NEVER experienced that in my life with any of my previous doctors...EVER.2) He took the time to discuss reasons for seeing him. (Sports injuries) plus talked about overall health. This wasn\\'t the typical 10 min in/out BS appointment I normally get from Drs. He was genuinely trying to get to know me which I appreciate. 3) Verna- had to draw blood and I HATE this part but she deserves 10 stars as she was damn good. They have an online scheduling system & can email Dr directly.If you need a Dr... look no further.,0GBmtExs01SYE_zVDP7eyw\\n7/2/2015,5.0,Dr Fong is the best!!! Pregnancy and delivery is such a terrifying and emotional event and Dr Fong\\'s professionalism and personality puts you at ease. I had a breeched baby for my second pregnancy and Dr Fong successfully conducted an ecv. I still ended up with a c-section due to the cord and baby\\'s leg position. I was in tears and Dr Fong was just so trustworthy that she calmed me and everything went great. She saved my delivery experience and I totally love her.,0GBmtExs01SYE_zVDP7eyw\\n10/26/2016,5.0,\"Doctor Michael Ford truly is one of the best medical practitioners I\\'ve ever encountered. He is attentive and kind, and I recommend anyone to see him. The staff are friendly, wait times are minimal, and they are very active with their app, making the whole process much easier.\",0GBmtExs01SYE_zVDP7eyw\\n7/23/2014,1.0,\"I found this office after my usual Gynecologist no longer accepted my insurance. I made the appointment, confirmed that they accepted my insurance and provided them with a card upon arrival. I met with Dr. Fong for about 2 minutes total. She was in and out and spoke so fast I had to ask her to repeat herself numerous times. I have never had an appointment that quick in my entire life - especially a first appointment with a doctor. Regardless, after an abnormal test result they contacted me and informed me I had to come in for a separate procedure. They prepared me that the procedure would take about 30mins but that I would be fine after. The procedure took about 10mins because once again Dr. Fong was rushing. Following both of these visits within a month, I received a bill from the office stating that they did NOT accept my insurance and that I owed them a total of $2300.... W T F. What is the point of asking to see insurance cards, copying them, etc. PRIOR to appointments if you are not going to inform patients that their insurance is not covered? I had also checked with my insurance company and they had them covered and dropped them a few weeks before my first appointment. I am now currently in the appeal process for bills over 2grand for less than 15minutes of the doctor\\'s time. I also looked at the bills and they are charging for Specialty visits when my visits were Preventative. I would make sure you do your research on your own with your insurance company the day BEFORE your appointment and also check your bills.\",0GBmtExs01SYE_zVDP7eyw\\n10/10/2012,3.0,\"Because of Judy F\\'s recommendation, I decided to try Dr. Fong. I was not happy with my last GYN located on Mott Street. Last doctor was nice and very smart but I was not happy with the way her staff handled the appointments. I had an appointment in my last gyn office that lasted over two hours when the total time the doctor spent with me was less than 10 minutes! Not cool. So I was on a search for a doctor who is willing to explain everything to me and made me feel like she was willing to spend as much time as it takes to explain everything. I just recently visit at Dr. Fong\\'s office. I actually got into her office early and Dr. Fong saw me right away. It was pretty fast. AWESOME! I hate waiting forever at any doctor office. Dr. Fong was quite friendly, listened to me and was willing to explain what methods she was going to use to diagnose my problems. Basically she made me feel taken care of and like she was really genuinely trying to help me, feelings I don\\'t get with most doctors nowadays. Thank you, Dr. Fong.\",0GBmtExs01SYE_zVDP7eyw\\n9/2/2015,1.0,\"Please please do not come here. I have dealt with now 2 years of stress from one visit. At the time I didn\\'t have insurance. I had gone to a clinic off Union Square and gotten some blood work, and was sent here for further analysis. The doctor I met with was lovely, but the way this company cheats money out of you in insane. I was used to not having insurance and asked the price before, and was prepared to pay in-office. Saw the doctor for 10 minutes, had more blood drawn, and he wanted me to have an ultrasound on the floor below. By the end of it I paid just $400. Steep, for what I had done, but worth it, of course, to know that everything was ok. So a few weeks go by, and I start getting bills. By the end of it I apparently owe them another $400. I assume it\\'s a mistake, seeing as I had already paid about that. I even checked my account to make sure it was taken out and am prepared to provide a fax of my bank statement. Only, when I finally talk to someone (after several phone calls and being passed around multiple people, of course) they tell me that when I was at the doctor\\'s office I only paid half of what I owed and this was the other half. I have multiple issues with this. I was not AT ALL informed of this beforehand or at the accounting desk, where I paid, which I\\'m sure is illegal. And never in my years have I heard of a visit, blood work, and an ultrasound amounting over $800. Absolutely insane. They tell me the expense is from the transfer of my blood to the lab. Uhmmm this kid must drive it there in a farrari if that\\'s how much he gets paid to move some blood. They are so so full of shit and at this point stop communicating with me. Mind you, i am not an irritable person to deal with on the phone. I know that most of the time people are just doing their job and it\\'s the system that\\'s the problem. But for whatever reason, the woman I\\'m in contact with tells me she\\'s going to talk to her bosses and call me back and then never does. I leave several voicemails and nothing. Until a couple of months later when I get a call from a debt collector, of course. I finally just paid it, now almost 2 years after the visit. I figure I\\'ll be paying more than $400 in accumulated interest if this effects my credit. I feel so defeated and taken advantage of. So please PLEASE go somewhere else!!\",0GBmtExs01SYE_zVDP7eyw\\n3/21/2014,5.0,\"I struck the doctor lottery when it came to picking a primary care doc and finding Dr Michael Ford. In the days of chop shop medicine, where doctors are allotted 10 mins for each appointment, the 30-40 mins that Dr Ford has spent with each appt seems like a medical luxury. He\\'s knowledgeable and super thorough, and seems genuinely concerned with whatever it is that brought you in. He\\'s personable and friendly, even remembering details from our small talk convo at previous appointment (\"\"so how\\'s the start up whiskey biz going?\"\"). The office also offers a personalized online user profile where you can access lab results, request Rx refills, message the doctor, or schedule an appointment. I haven\\'t had any problems getting an appointment, and wait times have been less than 5 mins. Definitely recommend\",0GBmtExs01SYE_zVDP7eyw\\n8/18/2012,4.0,\"Dr. Fong is moving on up. She\\'s now working for New York Weill Cornell College. I love her new digs. A welcoming and large waiting area WITH a television. There\\'s a water cooler and coat rack behind the entrance door. While in the exam room, I lied down on the bed which is so ergonomic that I took a nap while waiting for her. Such a step up from her old office on Market Street.

Knowledgeable if you have any questions.\",0GBmtExs01SYE_zVDP7eyw\\n7/9/2014,5.0,\"I really like everyone in the practice. I saw Dr. Fong throughout my pregnancy (my first) and she was fantastic. Warm, friendly, great at explaining things, and relaxed without seeming like she wasn\\'t paying attention to the important details. Basically, super-competent without being a panic-monger -- which was great, since I had a few \\'complications\\' (including being \"\"advanced maternal age\"\" -- i.e., over 35). I ended up having to be induced for medical reasons, and could not have been more impressed with the care I received, and the commitment to a vaginal birth. Dr. Fridel was amazing at getting my labor moving along (not easy -- my body did not want to cooperate) and Dr. Pena could not have been nicer and more supportive while I was pushing. Not a single complaint.The office staff is really nice. Generally running late, which can be annoying, but I think that\\'s pretty standard.

Fantastic!Staff in and out with blood draw, flu shot, measurements with military precision. Right on.Dr Ford assuaged my concerns on one issue while still offering to run the tests to give 100pct confidence. Prescribed a good non-invasive and inexpensive approach.Noticed a skin issue I hadn\\'t. Easily treated.

I asked if any obgyn were primary care, since I\\'ve seen one before that was from another institution. They told me theyre not sure what that means. As I was waiting, the staff was talking about their daily life casually in the office which I thought was very unprofessional given that you don\\'t know the condition of the patient. It hardly felt like a patient waiting area. I proceeded to make an appointment, which ended up only taking 5 minutes and later found out that what I thought was a preventative or health check up ended up not counting as one and they charged me $230 for less than 5 minutes of the doctors time. Unfortunately around the same time I also had a condition I wanted to check. Having to find out later that the obgyn was not a primary care doctor, though they never clarified that for me even though I asked specifically (the staff seems clueless and doesn\\'t even look happy that they work there) , I had to make a separate appointment to see a primary care doctor. I saw the doctor, explained to him my conditions, it was a total of 3 minutes. And he told me, I\\'m very sorry but I don\\'t think I can help you. And he referred to someone else. This again, costs me $230 because it didn\\'t count as a check up. So in total I was charged $460 and the doctors hardly did anything, nor was I given any tests. It was partially my fault as I should\\'ve been more thorough when requesting doctors and understanding my insurance, but the Weill Cornell staff did nothing to help me in the process, did not clarify any of my questions, and was unprofessional from beginning to end.

Since I don\\'t have out-of network coverage, the claim was denied. What? How is it in-network through out-of-network benefits? That doesn\\'t even make sense.They are in-network, she assure me, as long as you have out-of-network coverage.Again, what?At this point she finally admits they are an out-of-network provider and because I don\\'t have out-of-network benefits, the claim was denied. This is how they process many claims apparently. Dr. Zhang tells me she will \"\"look into\"\" getting the charges waived and get back to me \"\"in a day or two\"\". Mind you, this is after they sent my blood work to an out-of-network provider too, which they are not allowed to do in NYS without your written consent.They likely bill out-of-network because it\\'s more lucrative for the doctor, which is fine if patients agree to this. That said, if you don\\'t tell patients, so you can do it behind their back and spring large bills on them, that is just slimy unethical business.I will be bringing complaints against MiDoctor and Dr. Zhang through the appropriate channels, starting with the Office of Professional Medical Conduct.\",uk2_s6ZrQyly4W2q1Qsn5Q\\n3/15/2018,5.0,Every member of the staff has been wonderful from the front desk to the doctor and medical assistant.

Since I don\\'t have out-of network coverage, the claim was denied. What? How is it in-network through out-of-network benefits? That doesn\\'t even make sense.They are in-network, she assure me, as long as you have out-of-network coverage.Again, what?At this point she finally admits they are an out-of-network provider and because I don\\'t have out-of-network benefits, the claim was denied. This is how they process many claims apparently. Dr. Zhang tells me she will \"\"look into\"\" getting the charges waived and get back to me \"\"in a day or two\"\". Mind you, this is after they sent my blood work to an out-of-network provider too, which they are not allowed to do in NYS without your written consent.They likely bill out-of-network because it\\'s more lucrative for the doctor, which is fine if patients agree to this. That said, if you don\\'t tell patients, so you can do it behind their back and spring large bills on them, that is just slimy unethical business.I will be bringing complaints against MiDoctor and Dr. Zhang through the appropriate channels, starting with the Office of Professional Medical Conduct.\",uk2_s6ZrQyly4W2q1Qsn5Q\\n3/15/2018,5.0,Every member of the staff has been wonderful from the front desk to the doctor and medical assistant.

Recently, I received a statement in the mail saying I owed over $400. When calling their billing department to inquire about the bill, I was informed that their front desk representative can only verify if I have active coverage.

When my fever got really bad and I started feeling woozy, I popped a tylenol and headed over. I was seen within just a few minutes of arriving, and got tested for both strep throat (negative) and influenza (positive). I got a prescription for tamiflu and a talk about what to look out for that would lead me to come back, then sent on my merry/miserable way. The whole encounter was very professional, and they sent me out with lots of info about the flu and what I had to look forward to.In subsequent days, I called them several times to get clarification and check in, and then went in for a followup appointment. They offer free followups within two days, so I went in and got myself checked out again, just to be safe.

The nurse told him it was too soon to open the abscess then the doctor told him it was too late to drain it. (Huh?) They sent him home and said it would heal on its own (it\\'s been a month). A day later, it was still getting worse and extremely painful. We covered it and put ointment on it. A BOTFLY larva just fell out of it. The moment we googled it, we could see what it was. One second of internet research could have told them this. Now we can easily see that the abscess looked like a classic botfly infestation. But instead of actually looking into it, they chose to be dismissive for worrying about a bug bite in Belize. Idiots. It could have been worse even (he was starting to have a bad allergic reaction which is now over with the bug removed). Though really disgusting anyway.

The clinicians that I saw were some of the best I have seen and they even offered free mental health consultations, which is rare.The problem here is that this office is rife with the same BS that plagues most other doctors offices. Two things really bothered me. 1: They call the Nurse Practitioners \"\"doctors.\"\" If I\\'m going to be seeing a NP as my primary care provider, tell me that. Im not against it and they have very nice ones there, but referring to them as \"\"doctors\"\" is lying, plain and simple. 2: You can\\'t get a quote on what your tests will cost even if you beg. I want to know the price before agreeing to get the test, what is the f***ing problem with that? Nobody will do this anywhere and Oscar is no different. Even though they are consumer centric, they can\\'t be bothered to tell you what your bill will be before you get it in the mail.

They voluntarily shared with me estimates of my blood work and all that and I really really appreciated that. - Think Apple Genius Bar a little bit...it\\'s a little bit of that feeling. Not pretentious. Cons:- Don\\'t really have any just yet. It\\'s a new space so everyone is getting used to everything, but I get it. All new spaces take time to get used to.

We\\'ve had a change of insurance (ours old plan was good, the new plan is even better) -- and we\\'ve opted to keep him. If you want a knowledgable GP, you have that in him. I miss the days when your physician could spend more time with you, but those days are long gone. What helps to make up for it is that Dr. Chung takes good notes and is quick to come back to them. He\\'s embraced technology and it certainly helps make up a bit for what\\'s been lost in modern medicine and interpersonal communications. best of all, he makes us feel like we have a partner in our health. All said, I do have one honest complaint, its not about the quality of the care, its a technology issue... when the doctor\\'s office wants to communicate information through the web-portal... logging in is difficult at best, and the system tends not to allows password acceptance, which is a pain in the butt... but if I call, the staff rectifies the issue really quickly. It happens repeatedly -- solely a software issue, so no lowered star rating from me.And now, my service to the Yelp Community. Dr. Chung came recommended to us, having seen a number of Japanese people (my wife is Japanese, and she wanted someone a bit more familiar with her culture -- she\\'s been pleased). I read a review about a year ago that really was uncomplimentary toward Dr. Chung, by a patient who\\'d been prescribed some medicine with adverse effects. I asked Dr. Chung about the issue, and without breaking doctor/patient privilege, he told me his side. Having heard both sides, I want to tell you my thoughts. Don\\'t buy all of what you read. Some use Yelp to vent anger and frustration, and everyone who does -- especially millennials -- feel they are qualified critics (of nothing of course), can damage the usefulness of the service. Dr. Chung is a great physician, and he\\'s got a nice practice with great responsive staff -- every time we\\'ve called. My review is reflective of those merits, and hope that it may be an honest tool in guiding you in selecting a physician you like and feel comfortable with. There are no doubt wonderful GP\\'s (I previously had one, but he stopped taking all private insurance), you will be hard pressed to find one of better caliber than Dr. Chung.\",dfSu-wvc0HspajV9GmSceg\\n1/10/2017,4.0,\"I have been a patient of Dr. Bruce Chung for over 12 years. he is a soft-spoken doctor who gives detailed information and answers all questions needed.

More time in my physical was spent by nurses on their laptops filling out forms then the 5 mins checking on my vitals. The nurses move you from room to room to break up the overall waiting time from your appointment. They should reduce appointments scheduled for doctor since he is unable to keep up with schedule. Bloodwork that was needed is done offsite as well. They refuse to discuss any other minor issues at physical exam. They want you to come back and set another appointment.

He\\'s my new primary and I\\'d recommend him to anyone!\",dfSu-wvc0HspajV9GmSceg\\n11/9/2018,5.0,\"I\\'ve seen Dr. Chung now for two years with my wife. We\\'ve had a change of insurance (ours old plan was good, the new plan is even better) -- and we\\'ve opted to keep him. If you want a knowledgable GP, you have that in him. I miss the days when your physician could spend more time with you, but those days are long gone. What helps to make up for it is that Dr. Chung takes good notes and is quick to come back to them. He\\'s embraced technology and it certainly helps make up a bit for what\\'s been lost in modern medicine and interpersonal communications. best of all, he makes us feel like we have a partner in our health. All said, I do have one honest complaint, its not about the quality of the care, its a technology issue... when the doctor\\'s office wants to communicate information through the web-portal... logging in is difficult at best, and the system tends not to allows password acceptance, which is a pain in the butt... but if I call, the staff rectifies the issue really quickly. It happens repeatedly -- solely a software issue, so no lowered star rating from me.And now, my service to the Yelp Community. Dr. Chung came recommended to us, having seen a number of Japanese people (my wife is Japanese, and she wanted someone a bit more familiar with her culture -- she\\'s been pleased). I read a review about a year ago that really was uncomplimentary toward Dr. Chung, by a patient who\\'d been prescribed some medicine with adverse effects. I asked Dr. Chung about the issue, and without breaking doctor/patient privilege, he told me his side. Having heard both sides, I want to tell you my thoughts. Don\\'t buy all of what you read. Some use Yelp to vent anger and frustration, and everyone who does -- especially millennials -- feel they are qualified critics (of nothing of course), can damage the usefulness of the service. Dr. Chung is a great physician, and he\\'s got a nice practice with great responsive staff -- every time we\\'ve called. My review is reflective of those merits, and hope that it may be an honest tool in guiding you in selecting a physician you like and feel comfortable with. There are no doubt wonderful GP\\'s (I previously had one, but he stopped taking all private insurance), you will be hard pressed to find one of better caliber than Dr. Chung.\",dfSu-wvc0HspajV9GmSceg\\n1/10/2017,4.0,\"I have been a patient of Dr. Bruce Chung for over 12 years. he is a soft-spoken doctor who gives detailed information and answers all questions needed.

I come in once a year for a physical and can\\'t get time with my primary doctor. That is a total joke. More time in my physical was spent by nurses on their laptops filling out forms then the 5 mins checking on my vitals. The nurses move you from room to room to break up the overall waiting time from your appointment. They should reduce appointments scheduled for doctor since he is unable to keep up with schedule. Bloodwork that was needed is done offsite as well. They refuse to discuss any other minor issues at physical exam. They want you to come back and set another appointment. Probably wanting additional $ for another visit to doctor. Service is friendly, but always behind schedule.
